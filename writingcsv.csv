1, "How Much I Know About Space I had just gone to Chobot Space and Science Center. When I got there, I didn't even know one planet in our solar system. Soon I learned all eight planets in our solar system. I learned what the first rocket ship looked like. I learned how to land a rocket ship. I had two lessons. The lessons were fun. My favorite class was space class."
1, "My Favorite Pet My cat is fluffy. His name is Buzz. He is my favorite cat. Buzz is my favorite pet of all. I hug him all the time. He is soft, and his cheeks are fat like my brother's. I feel happy with my cat."
1, "Sweet Spring Spring is sweet because we can go boat riding, and bees come and take honey out of the flowers. I feel good because it is very, very, very hot outside, and I can go on the swings. The best part of spring is that my family can go to the beach."
1, "A Happy Day One day baby Josh came home. He was in a yellow blanket. My mom let me hold him. He was blowing bubbles. He didn't cry."
1, "My Trip to Mexico One time I went to Mexico. It was a blast! I met people there. I went horseback riding. I saw a box holding an armadillo. I went to a waterfall. I tried to catch a frog with one leg. I couldn't catch it. It was fun in Mexico."
1, "Happy Easter Once there was a hen. The hen was very lonely. Then she laid some eggs. They were not ordinary eggs. They were colorful. On Easter the chicks hatched. It was their birthday!  The hen was not lonely anymore."
1, "Leaf Person One morning, I turned into a leaf person. I went outside. A wind blew me away, far away. Another heavy, heavy wind blew me everywhere in the whole world. It never stopped! Then it blew me to outer space. I was floating in space. I went to Mars, but I saw nothing. I went back to Earth. I didn't know where I was, so I went on a rocket, back to space, to the  moon. When I landed there, there was nothing but crust, holes, and craters. Then there was another special wind. It was special because it blew from land to space. I was floating in space again!"
1, "Parrots Parrots are colorful. They have different colors like blue, red, black, orange, green, yellow, and white. Parrots live in cactuses, nests, and underground holes. Some parrots eat roots, and some eat nectar and seeds. They have different bills. Macaws (a kind of parrot) crack things open. Other parrots dig up roots and bulbs from the ground. There are different kinds of parrots, but they all lay eggs. Parrots are pretty birds."
2, "If I Were President If I were president, I'd be responsible. I'd look alert and run the United States like it should be run. I'd be honest. Then the people would trust me. I would be a good president because I have faith in the people of the United States."
2, "My Dad I was at the hospital when my dad was dying. My mom and my sister were there, too. Mom was lighting candles in my dad's room. My dad was going to have an operation. He said, I'm going to be in a better place. He said he loved me. My dad died after the operation. I don't know why my dad died. I was only five years old, but I still remember. I hope when your dad dies, you will always remember him, too. I miss my dad. His dogs miss him. My family misses him."
2, "The Horrible Day One morning I woke up and I was turned around on my bed. Then I fell off! I walked downstairs and I almost fell over my dog. Next I fell asleep in my cereal and my brother stole my toast! Then I had to walk to school because our car ran out of gas. I was late for school, and I got stuck outside in the rain! Guess what? I really didn't like this day at all."
2, "One Great Book I love the book McBungle Down Under by Brenda Parkes. My favorite part is when McBungle tried to get the koala in the gum tree. I like the book because it is so funny. I really like the end. It's great when they go to the pet shop and get a pet. If you like animals, you would like this book, too!"
2, "A Fable Once there was a bunny. He had a big problem. He didn't think he was special. He wanted to be someone different. He went for a walk. First he met a lion. The lion said, 'What are you doing, little rabbit? It is a lot of work watching my kingdom.' 'Well, then, I'll be on my way, said the little rabbit. He thought, 'I don't want to be a lion!' Then he met a turtle. The turtle said, 'What are you doing, little bunny? I have a long way to go and I'm really slow.' 'Well, then, I'll be off.' The last animal he saw was a mouse. The mouse said, 'I'm on the run from a cat.' 'Then I'll leave you alone,' said the little bunny. The bunny thought, 'I'm fine the way I am.' So the little bunny learned that he was fine the way he is."

2, "The Missing Coin It was the day after St. Patrick's Day, and all the little leprechauns were settling down for a nap. But one leprechaun named Sly was wide awake. He had lost his magic coin! Meanwhile a little girl named Emma had found the leprechaun's magic coin. 'Hey, look at this!' she exclaimed to her mom. 'Wow,' said her mom, 'I think it's a real leprechaun coin. Without it the leprechaun can't get around very fast. You'd better go to the woods and try to find the leprechaun who lost it.' So the girl hurried off into the woods. A few minutes after the girl entered the woods, she saw a little leprechaun moving very slowly through a patch of three-leaf clovers. She said, 'Here's your coin back.' The leprechaun was very grateful. He gave the girl three wishes and set off, never to lose his coin again."
2, "Winter Words I see the snow glittering in the sky. I have goosebumps going down my spine. The beautiful smell of candles burning all night, the new smell of winter shining bright. Snow is on the ground. The magnificent winter in my hand. Icy lakes cracked by too much pressure, the glorious sight of winter."
2, "Horses Did you know horses can point their ears more than we can? Did you know that horses can groom one another? Horses can also see more than we can. They can see what is behind and what is in front of them. Some horses live in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. Fifty-five million years ago horses were dog sized. Horses are black, brown, white, and spotted. Horses like to eat grass. Horses live on a farm and outside. Horses played a big role in the development of our country. They carried people west. They pulled covered wagons, firewagons, farmers' plows, and stagecoaches. They carried the mail. In the 1900s the horse was replaced by the car and the train. The largest horse is the Percheron. It is 21 hands high. The smallest horse is the Falabella. It is only 7 hands high. Horses usually have one baby a year. They live 25 to 35 years. I wish I could be like a horse because they know when they are in danger. They can see so well because their eyes are on the sides of their faces."
2, "Ladybugs Ladybugs are insects. Insects are bugs that have six legs. Ladybugs have all kinds of designs on their wings. They have dots, stripes, and other designs. In England ladybugs are called ladybirds. Ladybugs are harmless, but if you pick one up it will tickle you! Ladybugs are very helpful to farmers because they eat aphids. Aphids are tiny bugs that eat plants. Ladybugs' enemies are spiders and praying mantises. If you find a ladybug, don't smash it. Put it in some flowers nearby. If you like ladybugs as much as I do, then you should read The Grumpy Ladybug by Eric Carle. I love ladybugs!"
3, "How to Make Boiled Egg Materials: a pan, hot water, one or more eggs Step one: Pour the hot water into the pan and let it boil on the stove. Step two: When that’s done, put the eggs into the boiling water. Step three: Let them sit for about 10 minutes. Take the eggs out. Let them cool for about 5 minutes. Step four: If they’re still hot, let them cool for about 3 more minutes. Step five: Get a plate and a spoon. Peel off the eggshells and eat the eggs with a little salt and pepper. That is how to make boiled eggs."
3, "Plastic, Paper, or Cloth? We have a big decision to make. We can use cloth, paper, or plastic bags. I choose cloth because paper uses trees, and plastic uses petroleum; so we should use cloth. Cloth bags are easy to take with you and use again and again. We need to keep our earth clean, so let’s use cloth. Remember, recycle and reuse."
3, "The Funny Dance I remember when my dog Murphy was really little. She was only two or three years old. It was on Christmas. My dad put on some Christmas music, and Murphy put her paws up in the air and started swirling around in circles. Then she put her paws on my dad’s hands, and they started dancing together. It was very funny, and my dad thought that Murphy was a good dancer!"
3, "The Sled Run One day it snowed like crazy! So school was cancelled. I had Amy over to play. We decided to go sledding. So we started to slide down the hill. We sledded for a long time. One time we decided to go down together. Amy sat in the front seat, and I sat in the back. We started to go down the hill. Then CRASH! We ran into a bush! Amy went flying, and I got my feet caught in the bush! Amy looked like a spider caught in its own spider web. I had a lot of fun that day, and I will never forget it!"
3, "Fire Crackling against the wood I hear the smoke Run up the chimney. Ashes dodge out of the fire Hitting against my skin."
3, "Hello, Spring! When spring is in the air, Most of the flowers care. All the leaves grow on trees, And the people with allergies sneeze. All the boys run out, And their parents shout. We all sing about the day That spring flew into replay."
3, "Cheetahs You should never race a cheetah. Do you know why? Because you'll always lose. That’s because cheetahs are very fast runners. They can run up to 75 miles per hour. The cheetah gets its food by running. But sometimes the lion takes over and grabs the food. That's mean! Cheetahs are carnivores. That means they eat meat. Their prey are gazelles and rodents. The cheetah lives and finds food in Africa. The cheetah and the lion eat each other. If the cheetah is weaker, the lion eats the cheetah, and it's the same with the other. The cheetah has up to three to five babies. The cheetah has larger litters than other cats, but on average only two cubs live into adulthood. Cheetahs are amazing. I hope you like cheetahs. I know I do!"
3, "Subject: Thanks for the Vacation Pictures! Dear Ms. Nathan, Thanks for attaching your vacation pictures! You look great in them! Wow, traveling to Yosemite Park sounds cool. And it’s nice you and Dr. Nathan are doing something special every weekend. That’s great that you are playing the Mozart Concerto in C, even though you are playing an easy version. Yes! I am proud of you. I am in Level 3 in piano. Morse School is really looking great. They are almost done remodeling. I wish you could see it. I think we’ll get to move back in soon. My new teacher is Ms. Porter. Many of the kids you had last year are in Ms. Porter’s class. Please write back and tell me about California. Fondly, Andrea P.S. We had a lot of snow, about 17 inches."
4, "My Favorite Place to Go  Do you have a favorite place to go—a place with family, good weather, and fun things to do like crabbing? I’m glad I do. New Jersey is my favorite place for many reasons. The first reason is my family. Over half of my family lives in New Jersey. When I visit, my cousins and I laugh and play all day and night. My uncles and aunts take me to the boardwalk where we ride roller coasters. We devour juicy caramel-covered apples and foot-long hot dogs. My family is fun to be with. The second reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is the weather. Instead of being hot and sweaty, it’s always cool and moist. When I think about my visits, I can just feel the crisp fall breeze in my hair. I can just see the white, fluffy winter snow. I can just hear the soft spring trickles of rain splashing on the sidewalks. I can just feel the warm summer sun on my face. The weather is great! The third reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is crabbing. If it’s crab season, we crab. We keep the blue crabs and the snow crabs, and we let the others go. Sometimes we catch crabs on hooks, and sometimes we lower crab cages into the bay. Then we pull them out later. One time my brother caught a crab so big that it got stuck in the crab cage! The crab finally got out, but it hurt one of its legs and broke the cage trying. Poor crab! For all these reasons, New Jersey is my favorite place to go. If you don’t have a favorite place, I think you should search for one. It’s good to visit a favorite place—a place where you can make special memories. By the way, if you crab at your special place, be sure to get a big crab cage."
4, "My Mother Do you have someone who is great, spends time with you, cares for you, and is an important person? Well, I do, and she has black hair, brown eyes, and a caring touch. That’s my mom. My mom talks to me about many things. One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up. She tells me what to do in case of an emergency. And one day I had a really bad day with my friends, and she told me what to do about it. My mom and I spend a lot of time together. We play games, bake cookies, make necklaces, and draw doodle tricks. But our favorite thing to do is read. Our favorite book is If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. Mom takes me shopping at the mall. We buy toys and clothes, and we eat at the cafe. We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonald’s restaurant. When we ride the escalator, my mom pretends to fall back and says, \"My shoestring’s stuck!\" My mom always laughs, and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy! She doesn’t laugh every day, but when she does, it’s hilarious, and I have to laugh, too! My mom is the greatest. I love how she jokes around. She is always fun no matter what, and she gives me great advice. My mom is more than a mom; she is like my best friend!"
4, "Rules One day, on the way home from school, my mom told me she was going to make up some new rules for me and my brothers and sisters. Before this, we knew she wanted us to be good, but we really didn’t have any rules. Well, Mom took care of that. On Sunday, she started giving us the house rules. Clean your rooms every other day. Be ready for dinner at 7:00 p.m. (that means sitting at the table, with clean hands). If Mom is having a meeting in the house, be very quiet (that means turn down the music and the TV). Be ready for bed at 9:30 p.m. (that means lying in bed, with clean faces). Get up at 7:30 a.m. to get ready for school (that means your feet are on the floor, not just hanging off the bed). Take the garbage cans to the curb on Monday morning before school. Clean the bathroom on Thursday. Following these rules isn’t too hard, and sometimes it’s even fun. Other times, it can be tough. For instance, if your room is really dirty and you can’t finish cleaning it on that day, you have to finish it on the next day, along with anything else you have to do. That can be hard. Mom made these rules because she loves us a lot. She wants us to learn how to be on time, be clean and neat, and be polite. Every day, we try to follow her rules."
4, "Shadow Fort  I have a place I love to go. It’s a fort, or a clubhouse, where I can go with friends. We can hang out there, plan neat stuff, eat, and rest. Shadow Fort is my favorite place for lots of reasons. First of all, there’s plenty of room for a few kids. It’s large (gargantuan to me). The fort is 3 ft. 8 in. high, 5 ft. 3 in. long, and 3 ft. 6 in. wide. There’s a place in back (we call it the pantry) for crackers, grapefruit, avacadoes, potatoes, carrots, berries, and Spanish moss. The roof is made of 4-ft. palm leaves and smaller fronds. Second, this fort is the first structure I ever built, with the help of my friend Kevin. We built it during a light shower. It was only a few vines that tangled together to make a kind of cave that we could crawl under. We worked fast to put palm fronds and leaves over the vines. \"Quick! Let’s get inside!\" I shouted to Kevin. We got inside in the nick of time. It began to rain powerfully, and oh how the wind blew! But our fort kept us safe and dry. Later we named it Shadow Fort because it sits in a shady area. Finally, Shadow Fort is my favorite place because it has everything we need. We keep food in the pantry, a small cot to sit on, and we even have a plywood door. One time Kevin fell out of a tree and hurt his ankle. I helped him back to Shadow Fort where he rested on the cot. Then I made some \"dinner\"—crackers, carrots, and berries for dessert. Can you see why Shadow Fort is my favorite place? I hope so. When I’m there, I feel happy as a cat with cream!"
4, "Adopting a Pet from the Pound  Owning a pet from the pound or Animal Rescue League has many advantages. First of all, a child feels good about rescuing an abandoned or abused animal and giving it a whole new life. Besides, if the animals from the pound aren’t adopted right away, they might be put to sleep. Having a pet also means lots of responsibilities. A child has to feed, clean up after, brush, and exercise the pet. Another great advantage of having a pet from the pound is the price of these cute and cuddly animals. Pets from the pound cost a lot less than pets at a fancy pet store, which can cost hundreds of dollars. Once you adopt a pet from the Animal Rescue League, it will quickly become a part of your family. If you are thinking of adopting a pet, you might consider choosing a dog or a cat. Dogs and cats can bring lots of happy times to a family, and they can be excellent companions for a person who lives alone or someone who has lost a loved one. Dogs are also a wonderful source of protection. Cats are funny, and they may help to calm people down when they are sad or mad. Please consider adopting an animal. If you remember all of the advantages of adopting a pet from the pound, you might find the bird, mouse, hamster, dog, or cat of your choice."
4, "Letter to the Editor  Dear Editor, I’m writing to you about the Teacher-Who-Made-a-Difference contest. Ms. Wells made a difference to me! I think she should be the winner of your contest. Ms. Wells has done so much for me and for all of her students; this is the least I can do for her. First of all, Ms. Wells is helpful. She’s willing to help anyone in the classroom who needs help. My teacher always helps us with worksheets. On Friday, she showed me how to do something in math. If you ask her for help, she’ll help you. In addition, Ms. Wells is a kind person. She always lets her students stay in from recess. On February 26, she let our class have a Colonial Day. We got to dress up like colonists; it was a blast! Not only is she kind to kids, but she’s also kind to other teachers and parents. She is always thoughtful and considerate. Lastly, Ms. Wells donates her time to kids. She donates her lunch recess for Student Council, which meets in her room. Last fall, Ms. Wells promised me that she would come to one of my soccer games. Guess what? She did, even though she had a lot of school stuff to correct and had to leave for Chicago. In conclusion, I think Ms. Wells should be the winner of your contest. She is helpful and kind and gives her free time to students. I know you will agree with me that Ms. Wells is a Teacher Who Made a Difference. She’s the best! Sincerely, Melissa"
4, "Ann  Do you have a friend who loves you? Well, I did. Her name was Ann. She was a very close friend of mine. She was almost like family to me. Ann was very kind, and she had bright blue eyes and curly gray hair. I loved her very much. She invited me to go swimming every summer. We had a lot of fun all those summers. But she could not get in the water most of the time because she was sick. Sometimes my sisters would come swimming, too. But it was better with just Ann and me because I just wanted to spend time with her. Ann always listened to me when I had a problem. She was always there for me when I needed help on homework or had problems at school. Sometimes she would let me come in her house, and she would give me something to eat. Most of the time it would be an orange and a soft drink. Last summer that all changed. Ann was diagnosed with cancer. Two weeks after Ann was diagnosed with cancer, she died. Her funeral was not too long after that. My mom did not let me go to the visitation at the funeral home or to the funeral ceremony. My heart broke. Ann was no longer there with me. Now, it’s been a year since Ann’s death, but I still dream about her. Now it’s hard without her. My whole life has changed without Ann, and I really miss her. I know that everywhere I go there will always be a spot in my heart for Ann!"
4, "Grandpa, Chaz, and Me  It was a few months before my brother was born. My grandpa was perfectly fine, but then he went to the doctor for a checkup. The doctors found something wrong. They said they had to run some tests. Then they said he had colon cancer. The doctors wanted to run more tests, so Grandpa had to stay in the hospital for a while. After he got home, I played with him. He would always play with me and do all sorts of stuff. I loved my grandpa. I liked to hear him play his harmonica. He even tried to teach me how to play it. Then he had to go back to the hospital for surgery. He stayed there for a while. When he went back home, we went to his house. When we got there, my grandpa was lying on the couch. A couple of hours later, he died. I was scared, but I was only three years old. I was glad that I could see him and say good-bye. My grandpa died August 27, 2009. Four months later, on December 31, 2009, my brother Chaz was born. I wish Grandpa could have lived to see my brother. I really miss Grandpa, and so does my brother, even though he never met him. My grandpa did know that the new baby would be a boy because the doctor secretly gave him a note, and it made Grandpa smile."
4, "Indy’s Life Story  I am going to tell you about my dog and how I got him. I don’t remember exactly how it happened, but at some point my parents asked if I wanted to have a dog. I, of course, said yes. We couldn’t decide what kind of dog to get at first, but at last we found a great breed, the Shetland sheepdog. We called a good breeder. I was so excited about getting a dog! Before I knew it, I was on my way to the breeder. I went inside and saw dogs everywhere. It was so hard to pick which one to get. I saw one I liked. It was a small blue merle. He looked perfect, so I asked if we could get him. It turned out that he was too young to sell. So I kept looking. When I finally decided on one, we were all very happy. It still took a few weeks until he was old enough to bring home. It seemed to take forever until the day came, but it did. It was so exciting. We were on our way to pick up our newest family member. When we went to pick him up, we realized that we had everything except the most important thing, a name! On our way home, we came up with what seemed like the perfect name: Indiana. This name came from his head coloring, believe it or not. His head was the same color as Indiana Jones’s hat. Like all dog names, it was shortened to Indy and eventually shortened to Ind. We loved Indy, yet it wasn’t all fun and games. We had to make major adjustments for him. When he was young, we had to blockade parts of the house because they were too dangerous for him. Another reason we had to block things off was that Indy was not yet housebroken. We also had to move my cat’s food because Indy kept eating it. Finally, we had to build him a kennel. Yes, we had to make a lot of changes, but Indy has changed a lot since the day we got him. He is no longer a puppy, and he is housebroken! Now he’s pretty much everyone’s buddy. We are so glad we found him."
4, "Jet Bikes  Have you ever run a business from a playhouse? My friends and I have. It is a bike shop. We call it Jet Bikes. One day my friend Trent asked me and my brother Jared if we wanted to build a bike shop out of his old playhouse. Jared and I said, \"Yes.\" So we went to get permission from my mom to go to Trent’s house and get started. The first thing we did was get some things out of his garage. We got old, rusty bolts; new, shiny nuts; black tape; wrenches; half-empty cans of oil; and screws. Then we built a new roof for the playhouse. We also had to clean the dirt and leaves out of it. So far we’ve only worked on our own bikes because not many people know about our shop. We had to fix Trent’s chain a few times. We also had to fix his tire because it would go flat every five minutes. We changed the inner tube and also used some stuff called \"No More Flats.\" Now it never goes flat! When we are older, we plan on putting signs up around town and maybe even have a Web site. We will work on bikes as big as 20 speeds and as small as bikes with training wheels. We hope to have a lot of customers. Do you think you’ll ever come here with a bike for my friends and me to work on? I hope so because it would be fun to have some customers, and it might be fun for you to have kids fix your bike!"
4, "The Day I Took the Spotlight  Wouldn’t it be superb to have one moment when you took the spotlight, to have everybody clapping for you and cheering loudly? I have had that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—the day I took the spotlight! Sometime in February, my teacher told us all about the Woodmen of America speech contest. The topic was \"people who have overcome obstacles in their lives.\" I thought my great-grandma Lorraine Parsley, who has had recurring cancer 13 times and is still living, would be perfect. She has overcome a lot of obstacles in her life. A couple weeks later, the class gave their presentations. My teacher had to pick three to five students to go on to the next level. I was one of them! Then the top five from each of the three fifth-grade classes competed. The top seven would be the finalists; again, I was one of them! The top seven worked really hard. We had until March 15, 2001, to practice. March 15 rolled around. Before I knew it, I was in our school gym with people all around, including the judges, listening to every word I said. I was the sixth to present. I was soon done; what a relief! I knew the top seven got ribbons, certificates, and pins; but I still wanted that trophy. After the seventh person finished, the judges made their final decisions. They announced the winners. The third-place winner was Aunum, the second-place winner was Sarah, and the first-place winner was Kelli! I had just won first place! I was ecstatic. That was my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The students in the audience were going wild clapping and cheering! That was a moment I will always remember, when I took the spotlight!"
4, "A Story of Survival  \"Brian Robeson was stopped and stricken with a white flash of horror, a terror so intense that his breathing, his thinking, and his heart had nearly stopped.\" This quote from the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen shows why this book was too good to put down. Brian Robeson, an eleven-year-old boy, left his home in New York to go to Canada to see his father. He was on a plane (a two-person plane) in the middle of the Canadian forest when the pilot had a heart attack. Brian was stranded in the air with no real knowledge of how to fly a plane. Brian had to make the BIGGEST decision of his life: whether to keep flying or just let the plane drop. If he let it drop, the only weapon he had was a hatchet. I feel that the author of this book, Gary Paulsen, is trying to tell his readers, \"If you believe in yourself, you can survive on your own.\" I really liked this book because it sounded like it could really happen. I enjoy books like that, and I’d recommend this book to anyone. Also, as I said, it kept me reading. I couldn’t put it down until I found out what was going to happen to Brian."
4, "Chloe’s Day  The first thing I do when I wake up is lick myself with my pink, scratchy tongue. Then I get up and stretch. First I stretch my front legs, then I stretch my back legs. Next, I go wake up Erin’s mom by scratching on her door. Sometimes she sprays me with a squirt bottle filled with water to stop me, but mostly she gives me my favorite smelly salmon cat food with medicine in it. Then I sleep until lunch. When I wake up again, my stomach is growling, so I meow for more food. Usually Erin’s mom gives me more, but sometimes she tells me to go eat my hard, dry cat food. After lunch, I look out the patio door for birds, chipmunks, and squirrels. Sometimes, if I’m lucky, a chipmunk comes to the door and says hi. Then I lunge at the window to say hello back, but he scurries away with his tail up in the air. Next, I go into the den and lie on the floor for a rest. Then I notice a fuzzy twitching thing right next to me, and I start to chase it. After people start laughing at me, I realize that it is my own tail! After all that, I go into the living room and sleep again. When I wake up, it is supper time, and I am hungry. I want to eat again. Erin or her mom serves me some more scrumptious, smelly salmon cat food. Ahh! That tastes good. Then it’s time to go outside. I have an exciting time avoiding the sly coyotes and chasing after little night creatures. Finally, Erin’s dad opens the door to let me in. I go to Erin’s bed and sleep the rest of the night. Then a new day arrives, and my adventures start all over again."
4, "Did You Ever Look At . . . Did you ever look at the stars in the sky? What did you see? I saw the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper. I look very closely and see the shape of my face. Did you ever look at the sky on an afternoon? What did you see? I saw children in a train and a very big castle. Sometimes, if you look very closely, you may see your beautiful face. Did you ever look in the mirror? What did you see? I saw my beautiful skin, blond hair, and hazel eyes. Sometimes, if you look very closely, you will know that you are truly beautiful, too!"
4, "Dreams As your eyes flutter and your breathing slows, Teddy bear clasped in your hand, You hop on a beautiful train To a mystical, enchanted land. You step down on cloud steps And think, \"Is this actually real?\" Your breathing stops, and your eyes pop open; Shock is what you feel. Ladies dance in pink silk dresses, And their skin looks so fair While they talk and laugh with the wind And ribbons twirl in their hair. They fly over rainbows. They glide over streams. They dance on and on— Forever, it seems. You can ride on an eagle, You can wish on a star, And joy fills your body Wherever you are. Then you hear the sound of a rooster; It says you have to go. So you wake up with the sunrise And feel a charming inner glow."
4, "I Am Attean I am a swift hunter and a polite young man. I wonder if I can find my manitou. I hear my lost mother calling. I see my gone father hunting. want to learn the white man’s signs. I am a swift hunter and a polite young man. I pretend to hunt moose. I feel the wind behind me. I touch the rattling water. I worry about the white man's trap. I cry to see my camp leave. I am a swift hunter and a polite young man. I understand I must go hunt. I say there should be peace. I dream of unity with the white man. I try to be brave. I hope to see my camp again. I am a swift hunter and a polite young man."

Here’s a recipe: 1 lb. ground beef chopped onion (to taste) 1/2 t. salt 1 c. ketchup 1 T. mustard 1 T. sugar 1 T. vinegar Brown the meat and onion, and then add the rest."
4, "The Civil War  The United States went through a split, The South decided that they would quit. \"A house divided cannot stand,\" Rang Lincoln’s voice throughout the land. Then the Civil War broke out, Each side fought without a doubt. A war against slavery, a war to unite, Were two of the reasons for the North to fight. A battle to separate, and the right to own others, These were the reasons the South fought its brothers. After four long years, the North won the war, And all the states were united once more."
4, "The Haunted House  Have you ever been trick-or-treating when you came upon an old house and wanted to explore it? Well, I’ll tell you a story about five kids, Jake, Zach, John, Bob, and Sean, who did it. They were trick-or-treating in their neighborhood, going door-to-door, when they came upon an old house. \"Let's go in,\" Sean said. Everybody said they would. They started up the walk. The grass was overgrown, and there were a couple of broken windows. They got to the door, and it opened by itself. They went inside. They had flashlights with them, so they turned them on. The house was covered in cobwebs. They saw a sign that said, \"Beware,\" and it was pointing up to the second floor. They decided to go upstairs. When they got there, they saw a hallway with three rooms. One room had an old bed and a dresser. The second room was a bathroom. The third room was a sitting room. When they entered the third room, someone said, \"Hello.\" All the boys screamed and ran downstairs. When they were at the door, the voice said, \"Don’t you guys want some candy?\" They turned around and saw a man with candy standing in the hallway. They ran as fast as they could to Bob’s house. When they got there, they described the man to Bob’s mom. She said, \"That sounds like Mr. Craig. He lived there when I was a kid, but he died 30 years ago.\""
4, "The Terror of Kansas  It was 1:00 a.m. on a warm spring Wednesday, and it was storming outside. Casey was sleeping in her bed when she was awakened by a loud blast. It was the tornado siren. Just then her parents rushed in and said, \"Grab your pillow and one thing you want to save!\" She decided to grab her dog, who was sleeping in her room. Most of her other things she could replace, but she couldn’t replace a living thing. Then she heard a loud crash and ran downstairs with the trembling dog in her arms. When they were all downstairs, they started listening to the weather radio. The weatherman said that an F5 tornado was heading straight for Silver Lake Trailer Park, and, unfortunately, that’s where Casey lived. Soon Casey could hear the loud rumbling noise of her house being thrown this way and that. The basement door was shaking like a giant was trying to get it open. She put the pillow over her head and tried to forget what was happening. Many of Casey’s things were blown away—her bed, her dresser, her bookshelf, her books, and the painting her grandma had given her. Some of her books were found far away from her house, and her broken-up dresser was found a half mile away. Thankfully, her dog and her family were okay, but many neighbors were not okay. The tornado had lasted 20 minutes. So much had been lost in this terrible storm. Casey felt she would never be the same. She knew she would always remember the night that Mother Nature showed her destructive powers—the night Casey called Kansas Terror."
4, "When I Was Upside Down  When I was upside down, my smile became a frown. I wore a bright blue gown, but it made me look like a clown. As I was hanging upside down, the world was moving all around. My feet were on the roof, while my head was on the ground. While I was hanging upside down, my long brown hair was dangling down. My eyes were closed, my ears were shut, and I could not hear a sound. Hanging upside down was fun for just a day. Now I’m back on my feet, and I’m really ready to play!"
4, "Deer Don’t Need to Flee to Stay Trouble-Free!  Have you ever been in trouble and wanted to get away? The white-tailed deer can swim, run, hide, and fight to stay out of trouble. If you want to know how they do it, read on. In early April, fawns (baby deer) are born. After a few weeks, the doe (the mother deer) leaves her fawns to find food. The doe leaves her fawns in a bushy place. The trees and grass can help keep the fawns from being seen by hungry predators. The white-tailed deer has many predators, such as these: mountain lions, bobcats, leopards, lions, dogs, bears, tigers, coyotes, wolves, and even humans. The fawns’ camouflage hides them in April’s trees and golden grasses. In spring, the fawns’ fur is brown with white spots. In summer, the fawns’ white spots disappear and never come back. In winter, their fur is gray, which helps them hide in the snow. When the deer see, smell, or hear something suspicious, they stick their white tails up to signal that danger is near. The leader will run, and the others will follow. When a deer is chased to water, it knows what to do. The deer will win this battle. The deer runs into the water and swims to the deepest part. If the predator thinks it’s going to win the battle, it is wrong. The deer will kick and thrash until the predator drowns or walks off wounded. If a deer is in a wide-open field and notices a predator, it will run zigzag to get away. It runs zigzag to confuse the predator. If the deer ran straight, it could become a venison feast. There is one more way that deer stay out of trouble. Bucks fight with weapons called antlers. These are different from horns because they are attached to the skull, and horns are not. Antlers are made of bone and have vitamins in them. The deer can use its antlers to protect itself. Deer stay safe by hiding, swimming, running, and fighting. Whenever you see a deer raise its tail, you know that it has seen a predator."
4, "Height-Challenged German Shepherd  Have you ever seen a dog with big ears and short legs? Was it so irresistibly cute you just wanted to take it home? Chances are, you were looking at a Pembroke Welsh corgi. Let me introduce you to a dog of very high intelligence. Since Welsh corgis are so intelligent, they are easy to train. One of the jobs they are good at is herding sheep and cattle. Welsh corgis are also very loyal companions for people of all ages. The Welsh corgi’s small size means it doesn’t take up much room as a pet. Its average height is 10-12 inches, and an adult dog weighs approximately 25-30 pounds. Welsh corgis were originally bred in Wales. They come in several colors: red, sable, fawn, or black and tan, with or without white markings. Their coats are a medium length, and they need to be groomed and exercised regularly to stay healthy. The corgi’s life span is 12 to 14 years. Welsh corgis are known for being bold but kind, friendly, and alert. They are friendly to all, good with children, and rarely aggressive. Next time you see a dog that looks like a German shepherd in the front seat of a car, look again. It may be a dog with a full-sized body and half-sized legs—not a height-challenged German shepherd. When it hops out, you might just drop your jaw."
6, "Friendship A dictionary contains a definition of friendship somewhere in the F’s between the words \"fear\" and \"Friday.\" An encyclopedia supplies interesting facts on friendship. But all the definitions and facts do not convey what friendship is really all about. It cannot be understood through words or exaggerations. The only way to understand friendship is through experience. It is an experience that involves all the senses. Friendship can be seen. It is seen in an old couple sitting in the park holding hands. It is the way they touch, a touch as light as a leaf floating in the autumn air, a touch so strong that years of living could not pull them apart. Friendship is seen in a child freely sharing the last cookie. It is the small arm over the shoulder of another as they walk on the playground. Seeing friendship is not casual. It is watching for subtlety, but friendship is there for eyes that can see. Friendship can be heard. It is heard in the words of two friends who squeezed in lunch together on an extremely busy day. It is the way they talk to each other, not the words. Their tone is unique. Friendship can be heard by those willing to listen. Friendship is felt in a touch. It is a pat on the back from a teammate, a high five between classes, the slimy, wet kiss from the family dog. It’s a touch that reassures that someone is there, someone who cares. The touch communicates more than words or gestures. It is instantly understood and speaks volumes beyond the point of contact, to the heart. Friendship has a taste. It tastes like homemade bread, the ingredients all measured and planned, then carefully mixed and kneaded, then the quiet waiting as the dough rises. Hot from the oven, the bread tastes more than the sum of its ingredients. There is something else there, perhaps the thoughts of the baker as her hands knead the dough, or her patience as she waits for the dough to rise. Unseen and unmeasured, this is the ingredient that makes the difference. Warm, fresh from the oven with a little butter, the difference you taste is friendship. Friendship has a smell. It smells like the slightly burnt cookies your brother made especially for you. It smells like your home when stepping into it after being away for a long time. It smells like a sandbox or a sweaty gym. Friendship has a variety of smells. Taken for granted at the moment, they define the memory of friendship. Finally, more than the other senses, friendship is an experience of the heart. It is the language of the heart—a language without words, vowels, or consonants; a language that, whether seen, felt, heard, or tasted, is understood by the heart. Like air fills the lungs, friendship fills the heart, allowing us to experience the best life has to offer: a friend."
6, "What Really Matters  Margaret L. is like any other teenage girl today: she talks on the phone, deals with the stress of schoolwork, and has a boyfriend. Unlike many of her peers, however, Margaret takes medication as part of her morning routine; and the time she spends in the school bathroom is not devoted to fixing her hair. Margaret has spina bifida, a condition in which one or more of her vertebrae did not form properly, leaving her spinal cord—the most vital component of the central nervous system—unprotected. She has had eight operations and wears braces on her legs to keep them in the proper positions. Throughout all of these ordeals, she has retained her outgoing personality and positive view of life. The 14-year-old attends high school and is not in any special classes. She is allowed extra time to get to class when she needs it. She says, \"I get it [teased] a lot, but I do have a small group of friends who are great about everything.\" Margaret has had the support of her parents as well: \"I think that, growing up with a disability, the best thing that I have had is supportive parents; without them I don’t know where I would be. They both have always said that I could do something if I really wanted to.\" After school on most days, Margaret works at Able-Disabled Advocacy (A-DA), an organization that helps the disabled, alongside her mother, Cindy. On other days she plays wheelchair basketball and tennis, even though she is not wheelchair-bound herself. Her evenings are spent at A-DA and doing schoolwork, such as the recent project on a genetic medical condition for which she selected spina bifida as her topic. Margaret met her first serious boyfriend, Juan, when they played against each other during a wheelchair basketball tournament. \"We were complete enemies on the court,\" she says. They met again at a Spina Bifida Association conference. They danced together twice. Later she realized the special connection they shared, both having a disability. Margaret feels that, far from having limited her, her disability has allowed her to do things she might not have been able to do otherwise. She says that she would not have been involved in sports at all if it was not for wheelchair sports, and she would not have some of her current friendships or her boyfriend. Rock climbing, cycling, and downhill racing (a kind of cycling) are some of the other activities she is able to participate in. Margaret also volunteers in an inclusion program at a Jewish community center, helping other kids with disabilities. The prognosis, or outlook, for most people with spina bifida is excellent, and Margaret is thinking about the future. \"I want to be a doctor of some kind,\" she says, \"though I’m not sure what kind yet.\""
6, "Cheating in America  Did you know that 7 out of 10 students have cheated at least once in the past year? Did you know that 50 percent of those students have cheated more than twice? These shocking statistics are from a survey of 9,000 U.S. high school students. Incredibly, teachers may even be encouraging their students to cheat! Last year at a school in Detroit, teachers allegedly provided their students with answers to statewide standard tests. Students at the school told investigators that they were promised pizza and money if they cheated on the test as told. Similar allegations at several schools in San Diego county have prompted investigation. A student at a local high school says she sees students cheating on almost every test, and the teachers don’t do anything about it. The kids claim that they’re tempted to cheat because of peer pressure and intense competition to get top grades. Many kids also say that their parents are setting a bad example by \"fudging\" on income taxes, lying about age to pay lower admission prices, or cheating their way out of a speeding ticket. They are sending a message to their kids that it is okay to cheat and lie. Finding solutions to this problem is difficult. In our school’s math classes, each student has different problems on their test papers, so it is useless to look at someone else’s answers. Teachers could also randomly mix the problems throughout the page. Another solution is for adults to lower their expectations. Chances are that students believe cheating is the only way to meet unreasonably high expectations. Perhaps it is time for parents and teachers to seriously examine whether higher test results are important enough to encourage cheating."
6, "Hang Up and Drive  You see it every day, especially in freeway traffic. A car is weaving back and forth, speeding up then slowing down, or suddenly stopping. No, it’s not a drunk driver. It’s a cell-phone driver. Cell phones are used everywhere, but on the road they are a dangerous distraction to drivers and should be prohibited. The New England Journal of Medicine reported that \"motorists using a cell phone were four times more likely to have an accident than those not using a phone.\" The major problem is that the driver is not focused on the road, but on his or her conversation. Cell-phone drivers are very unpredictable: they weave, tailgate, drive too fast or too slow, make improper turns, run red lights, and even stop at green ones. It’s not only annoying; it’s hazardous. Cell-phone-related accidents include rear-ending vehicles; running off a road and crashing into trees, fences, and buildings; flipping over; and having head-on collisions. Many of these accidents result in fatalities. In October at the California Traffic Safety Summit, experts testified that \"cell phones used by drivers lead to at least 1,000 deaths per year in California.\" These are the same problems that occur with drunk driving, which is strictly outlawed and harshly enforced. For the same reasons, California needs laws that restrict the use of cell phones in cars. Until we take action to pass new laws, drivers at least need to be more responsible when using cell phones. The American Automobile Association recommends that drivers pull off the road before using a cell phone, have a passenger use it for them, or use voice mail to answer calls. Another suggestion is to keep the phone off while moving or simply not use it in the car. Before using a cell phone, drivers should think to themselves, \"Is this call really that important?\" Cell phones can be a vital link in emergencies, but drivers need to use them wisely. As professional NASCAR racer John Andretti says, \"Driving safely is your first responsibility.\" The best road to safety is to just hang up and drive."
6, "Musical Arts \"Fine arts are important in the curriculum because of what they do for learning,\" stated Patty Taylor, arts consultant for the California State Department of Education. In other words, the arts, especially music, should be part of every school’s curriculum at every grade level. Music makes students smarter, gives children something positive to do, and builds self-confidence. Most students don’t have a chance to learn music outside of school, and everyone deserves that opportunity. Students would be much smarter if they had some music experience. They would improve their classroom skills, like paying attention, following directions, and participating without interrupting. People develop all these skills when they learn music. Musicians are also better in math, and they get higher S.A.T. scores. For instance, a study by the College Entrance Examination Board reported, \"Students with 20 units of arts and music scored 128 points higher on the S.A.T. verbal and 118 points higher in math.\" A Rockefeller Foundation study states that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical school. Making music also lets children use their imaginations, unlike playing with video games and electronic stuffed animals. \"It provides students a chance to try out their own ideas,\" according to the California Educator. Music makes children well-rounded students. Music not only makes children better students but also gives them something positive to do. In a music program, children can be part of a band or choir instead of getting into trouble. Parents can enjoy listening to their children’s music instead of seeing them glued to a computer or TV screen. In band, students get to be part of a team. They can interact with old friends and make new friends through music. In fact, on her Web site \"The Musician's Brain,\" Lois Svard explains how music stimulates \"mirror neurons,\" which synchronize performers but also help them empathize with each other. As the great choral conductor Eric Whitacre said, directing a choir is all about getting a room of people to breathe together. In many ways, music helps people connect. Music builds self-confidence. It gives children a sense of accomplishment and success. Making music is something for them to be proud of, and it lets kids practice performing in front of an audience. As reported in the California Educator, \"It gives [students] self-confidence and a feeling of importance to have a skill someone appreciates. They are also learning how to accomplish something from beginning to end and actually come out with a product that they can be proud of.\" Music gives children an outlet for self-expression, and that helps develop their self-confidence. Once again, music is important because it can make children better students, give them something positive to do, and build their character. Unfortunately, the children who need music lessons the most usually don’t have access to them outside of school. That is why music should be offered in every single grade in every school."
6, "Summer: 15 Days or 2 1/2 Months? The final bell rings. It’s the last day of school, and summer has finally come! Students don’t have to think about school for at least another 2 1/2 months. That is the way it should always be. Schools should continue using the traditional calendar and not a year-round schedule. There are numerous downsides to year-round schooling. It has no positive effects on education, it adds to costs, and it disrupts the long-awaited summer vacation. Contrary to the well-accepted belief, year-round schooling has no constructive impact on education. Most year-round schedules use the 45-15 method: 45 days of school followed by 15 days off. Because of this, there are many first and last days of school. All those transitions disrupt the learning process. Also, there is no evidence of higher test scores. Due to that, many schools that change to year-round schedules end up switching back. For example, since 1980, 95 percent of schools that tried the year-round schedule changed back to a traditional calendar. It is obvious that changing to year-round schooling does not help students; therefore, why is the change necessary? Like any other facility, keeping a school open requires a great deal of money. When a school changes to a year-round schedule, the costs skyrocket. Keeping school open in the middle of summer requires air conditioning, and that adds significantly to the school’s expenses. The usual utility bills grow because of the additional open-school time. Finally, teachers must be paid for all the weeks they are working. With all these factors, the cost of keeping schools open becomes immensely high. For example, a high school in Arizona had a cost increase of $157,000 when they switched to year-round schooling. Some schools may not be able to handle such increases, and other schools that can handle these expenses could be doing better things with the money. Is year-round school really where the money should go? An important part of a child’s life is summertime. With year-round schedules, students would hardly have any time to relax. During the 15-day breaks, they would be thinking about their quick return to school. It would also be difficult to coordinate family vacations with parents’ work schedules. Similarly, children would not be able to go to most summer camps. One expert, Dr. Peter Scales, says, \"The biggest plus of camp is that camps help young people discover and explore their talents, interests, and values. Most schools don’t satisfy all these needs. Kids who have these kinds of [camp] experiences end up being healthier and have fewer problems.\" Obviously, the summer is crucial to a child’s learning and development. Why should this invaluable part of a young person’s life be taken away? It is evident that year-round schooling is not the best option for the school calendar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional school year. Why change something that works so well? The final bell rings. Let’s make sure this bell means that the \"real\" summer vacation has come."
6, "A Cowboy's Journal I am so upset at myself. I don’t know where my head was. Finally, here I was, with $80 to my name (which is meager compensation for a two-month cattle drive), and then I lose it all gambling. Just one night, and now I am bankrupt all over again. Yesterday was my 22nd birthday, as well as my payday, so I allowed myself a little gambling in Abilene, Kansas, a cow town. But I got so caught up in the action that I couldn’t stop, and pretty soon, I was broke. I had been hoping to save enough money to start my own business, Bronco Jones and Company, but I suppose that will just have to wait for the next cattle drive. Hopefully, by then I will have better sense. But enough talk about that. I shall write about the cattle drive, in case I ever look back in this journal 20 years from now and wonder what it was like. Cowhands have very tough jobs, not to mention boring at times. I am a swing rider, and I help keep the cattle from straying. There are several other cowhands and, of course, a point rider and a cook. Lucky for us, we now have a talented cook who can turn anything into a delicious meal. We've had much worse cooks in the past. One little piece of excitement that sticks out in my mind is the day a single gunshot started a cattle stampede. I didn’t even have time to wonder where it came from, for in a split second, the longhorns had already taken off at an alarming run. It was all chaos for some time. Finally we managed to slow down the stampeding herd by turning them in a wide circle. That memory shall certainly amuse me for some years to come, and I do need some fun, for tomorrow I am returning to Texas for yet another cattle drive. I hope it's my last."
6, "Giving Life  It was a hot summer day. My dad and I were getting ready to go out for a ride on the boat with my friend Katie and the dog. That’s when the phone call came, the call that made that bright, beautiful day a cold, dark, gloomy one. I had just put on my suit, shorts, and tank top, and packed my bag with sunscreen and everything else I would need for the day. I ran into my parents’ room to find Dad. When I saw him on the phone, he was crying. I’d never seen my dad cry before. My heart sank. What possibly could have happened? \"Max, I’m so sorry,\" I heard him say. That’s when it hit me. I knew that Suzie had died. Max has been my dad’s best friend for years. Suzie, his daughter, had a rare disease that mainly affected her body. Her brain was OK. She knew what was going on; she knew that she had problems and was different than other kids. Once she told her dad that she wished she could die and be born in a different body. Yet although she couldn’t live a normal life, she was still happy. When Suzie and I were little, we spent quite a bit of time together. As we grew up, we grew apart. She lived in New York, and I lived in the Midwest. When Suzie was ten she had to live in a hospital in Virginia. About eight months before she died, Max gave us her number at the hospital and we talked at least twice a week until the end. Suzie was always so excited to talk to us and wanted to know every detail about my life. She wanted to know everything I did and everything I ate. In a way, she lived through me. After we found out about her death, we made our plans to go to New York for the funeral. When she was alive, I sent her a Beanie Baby and she sent one back to me. I had bought her another one but never had the chance to send it to her, so I took it to put in her casket. Her funeral was very different than any funeral I’d ever been to. After they lowered her casket, each one of us put a shovelful of dirt over her. I remember crying so hard, I felt weak. My cheeks burned from the tears. My whole body was shaking as I picked up the shovel, but I’m glad I did it. When Suzie and I first started calling one another, I thought it would be more of a burden on me, but I was completely wrong. I learned so much from her. She gave me more than I could ever give to her. I will never forget her or the talks we had. I now know that I must never take anything for granted, especially my health and the gift of life."
6, "The Great Paw Paw  Memory. The dictionary defines it as the mental ability to recall past experiences. We think of it as that picture we saw, the words she said. Who in your life is so vivid in your memory that you could describe him or her without a second thought? For me, it’s my grandpa. But when I was small, I couldn’t say \"Grandpa,\" so 13 years ago, Theodore Lazarus became Paw Paw. To all the grandkids, Paw Paw was full of fun and games. We all remember his favorite expressions, the ones that would pop out each time we saw him. Luckily, we visited Paw Paw quite often. We often overheard his little squabbles. \"No way, José!\" Paw Paw would yell; in response, we would shout back, \"Yes way, José!\" and burst into giggles. My younger siblings and cousins would tell Paw Paw about school, or ballet, or baseball, or their pet iguana, and just when they got into the story, he’d roar, \"No kiddin’!\" with a huge smile on his face. Paw Paw helped us remember that life should be fun. Being the oldest of all the grandchildren, I remember more than my siblings and cousins do, but we all remember how predictable Paw Paw’s clothes would be. Most likely, he’d be wearing a white cotton shirt under another shirt, which was the kind that is red or blue, has one or two breast pockets, is plaid or striped, with buttons down the front. Being loose, it covered his big, round belly. He’d be sitting in the tall wooden chair in the corner by his desk, shouting into the black telephone with the big buttons. Or, if he wasn’t there, he’d be in his black leather recliner, watching a game on TV. Sometimes he’d let us snuggle next to him. When Paw Paw wasn’t relaxing, he’d be in the backyard garden, weeding and pulling, planting and potting, until the time came in the spring or summer when the garden came alive with the colors of the flowers and vegetables he raised. I remember his old, worn hands that did everything: built the wooden tree house for me to play in, built the toolshed, plugged in the Barbie car so it would be ready for me to ride when I came over, fixed the DVD player so I could watch \"Wee Sing,\" and just played blocks with his grandchildren. He always took time to play with us. He would never tell us, but I know he was proud of all his nine grandkids. We ranged in age from 1-12 when he died last summer of a severe stroke. When I remember Paw Paw now, I think of the pictures on Grandmother’s cabinet—pictures of me and Paw Paw when I was two years old and the only grandchild. In one picture, we’re lying on the bed, me in my flowered pajamas, him in his usual outfit. I had my bottle in one hand, the Sunday comics in the other (upside down!). He was reading the comics to me so we could laugh together. I will remember that for the rest of my life, and I will remember that he always loved me."
6, "The Racist Warehouse  It was a beautiful August morning. The sun was brightly shining on my sunglasses while my mother drove the U-haul truck to a warehouse in Santa Ana, California. As my mother drove down the streets of Santa Ana, I looked out the window and began to realize that the mixture of people was no longer a mixture; there was only white. When we arrived at the warehouse, I had to peel my arm off the side of the hot door like a burnt sausage off a skillet. There were not many cars in the parking lot, and I could see the heat waves. As we walked up the boiling pavement, it felt like we were walking through a scorching desert. When we walked into the warehouse, there was a variety of electronic appliances to choose from, and about three-fourths of them were white (of course). About every 15 minutes, a salesperson followed us around and asked if we needed help, as if we were retarded or ex-cons. My mother really dislikes it when salespersons constantly ask if we need help; she feels if she needs their help, she’ll ask for it. Finally, after about two and a half boring hours of looking for any scratches or marks on the dryers and refrigerators that might fit best in our new apartment, my mother picked a dryer and refrigerator that were just right. She then let the salesperson know, and he replied with a smile, \"All right, you can pick up your items in the back in about five minutes.\" My mother said, \"Thank you,\" in a nice, friendly voice and walked across the scorched pavement to drive the truck to the back. When we got to the back, there were about three open spaces for picking up appliances. My mother chose the first parking spot she saw, which was by a white family’s car. Then she showed the employees the receipt for the appliances she had just bought. They said, \"All right, we’ll be with you in just a minute.\" While I waited for my mother, I looked over and smiled at the white lady in the next car, but instead of smiling back like a nice young woman, she frowned at me like I had something hanging from my nose. At first I thought, \"Well, maybe she is having a bad day.\" Then a few minutes later the people working at the warehouse started to look at my mother and me in a mean way. Then I figured that maybe something was on my face, but when I looked in the mirror, I saw nothing. At the time, I had only spent nine years and some months on this planet. I didn’t know racism was still around; I thought that situation had died along with Dr. King. Five minutes passed, then ten, then fifteen. We sat there watching people get their appliances and leave. We seemed invisible to them. As I sat in the car, burning up and listening to one of the most boring radio stations my mother could possibly like, I was thinking, \"We’d better leave or else I’ll go ballistic!\" After 30 minutes had passed, my mother got frustrated and politely asked to have our items loaded. Five more minutes passed, and she asked again with an attitude. They replied, \"We’ll be with you in a minute, ma’am.\" I could tell she was beginning to get upset because she started to get that \"don’t bother me\" look. Five minutes later they finally packed our appliances on the truck. When we left the warehouse, I described to my mother what the other people were doing. She explained, \"They were racist. They didn’t like us because we have different skin color.\" That was my first encounter with racism. It was just a small slice of reality—that everyone isn’t going to be as nice as you, your friends, and your family might be; and that just because you look nice and politely smile at others, it doesn’t mean that others will treat you the same. This situation made me feel very out of place and confused. I didn’t expect those people to react as they did. We are all civilized, intelligent, caring, peaceful people . . . or at least that is what I had believed."

Travel to the redstone house; Do not wake a single Mouse. On the night of Nameday Feast, You must leave and travel east. Do not meet the Greatrat horde. Build a boat, get right on board; Travel east across the lake. Still—a noise you must not make! Once you reach the mountain bold, All the mystery will unfold."
6, "The Best Little Girl in the World In the book The Best Little Girl in the World, Kessa has a serious eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. But she is not alone. Many people have this eating disorder, and this book shows its harmful effects. This is an emotional and invigorating story of a determined girl and her fight to survive. In the beginning of her story, Kessa is a normal 15-year-old. She has many talents, especially dancing. She has danced for many years and loves it. One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides to not eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Her new eating habits continue, and she begins losing weight. One after another, she loses the pounds, and her body becomes slimmer and slimmer. She loses weight to a point where she is extremely unhealthy. As her poor eating habits continue, her parents start interfering. They want to get as much help as possible to cure their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa’s parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. They are baffled by their daughter’s strict diet. She lives day in and day out, exercising to lose more pounds and planning what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa’s dieting continues. She is determined to have no fat on her body. Her obsession continues. Kessa’s doctor and parents finally decide to admit her to the hospital. She is now so skinny that she can barely walk. There, she goes through a nightmare. Despite good care, all Kessa can think about is how much weight she might gain. Throughout the rest of the book, Kessa goes through many troubles in order to cure her eating disorder. Many other people have this same disorder. This book, I think, can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves. It shows the trouble that people go through just to be slender, and all the scary things they must experience to be cured. It is an emotionally powerful book about a girl’s fight to survive, and I think every teenager should read it."
6, "How the Stars Came to Be  Long ago and once upon a time, there lived a princess. Her name was Oriana, and her entire court loved her. She always helped those in need and had a smile for everyone. Oriana wasn’t vain, although she had every reason to be. She had wavy, raven hair that fell past her knees; pure, olive skin; and a face that was perfectly oval. Her real beauty, however, lay in her eyes. Whenever Oriana felt an emotion strongly, they changed from their usual ebony to true gold. It seemed that nothing could make her angry; but alas, it was not so. Her aunt ruled the kingdom while Oriana’s father was away tending to his people’s needs. Aunt Desdemona was selfish, petty, and cruel. She was proud of her immortal beauty and didn’t hesitate to show it. The people hated and feared her. Jealous of the way the court adored her niece but detested her, Desdemona devised a plan. If she were to send Oriana on a quest to find the lost crown . . . yes, that would work. The crown was the key to the realm’s power. It had been taken away by an immortal centuries ago, and the kingdom had been having difficulties ever since. Only someone of royal blood could touch the crown, so that fact gave Desdemona a legitimate reason for sending Oriana to reclaim it. Oriana’s father wouldn’t be able to argue with such a decision. Smiling a smile that didn’t reach her ice-blue eyes, Desdemona called her niece to her chambers. She proceeded to explain that the king needed the crown if they were to save the kingdom from ruin. \"And don’t come back until you’ve got the crown.\" Oriana sighed and nodded. No matter what her aunt thought, she wasn’t stupid. She knew that Desdemona just wanted to get rid of her. Where on earth was she supposed to find the crown? They had been looking for centuries and no one had ever found it! And at night, alone, she was liable to get killed. There was nothing in night’s sky to light her way, and Oriana couldn’t possibly carry enough oil for a lantern. \"The sky is so frightful at night. During the day it is pretty, with the sun, but at night it is solid black . . .\" Lost in her thoughts, Oriana didn’t realize that she had already exited the castle grounds. Then a thought popped into her mind so suddenly that she gasped. \"Maybe no one has found the crown on earth, because it isn’t on earth anymore! But where could it be?\" Then her mind snapped everything into place, like pieces of a puzzle. If the immortal that stole the crown had wings, maybe it had hidden the crown in the sky. Oriana groaned. This just presented another problem: How was she supposed to search the sky? Abruptly, an immortal’s voice echoed in her head. \"Well done, Mortal. You are the first of your kind to get this far. The rest will not be easy. In a few moments it will be dark. I will place you in the sky. You have tonight, and tonight only, to solve my riddle and locate the crown. If you lose, you must stay in the sky forever. Are we agreed?\" About to say, \"Yes,\" Oriana was stopped by a chuckle. \"I can hear your thoughts, Mortal. Be prepared to lose!\" The sun started to dip below the horizon. The rest of the sky was already dark, and the last red glow reminded Oriana of blood. Red turned to black, and then the world was below her. It was time to begin the search. The immortal spoke again, \"Here is my riddle: Near yet far, Conquer the dark, Is it needed by the czar? Make your mark. End of the day, As the light fades away, Remember this— Nothing gold can forever stay. Oriana almost started to walk before she realized that she would be lost in pitch blackness. Thinking desperately of how to light her path, she looked down. Her necklace, made of shiny beads, was glowing brightly. Breaking the clasp, she started to move. Every few seconds she dropped a bead. She wandered all over the sky, trying to solve the riddle. It didn’t make any sense. Oriana went left, right, east, west, diagonally, all directions everywhere—occasionally, she dropped one of the sapphires or rubies from her necklace as well. Finally, Oriana reached the round silver stone in the middle of her necklace. She had only half of her light source left and wasn’t any closer to finding the crown. Tossing the silver ball into the inky darkness, she continued. Just as dawn was about to grace the sky, Oriana realized two things. The beads crisscrossed in every direction; some had been kicked into funny-looking clusters. And the crown? It was still lost. She remembered the last line of the riddle: \"Nothing gold can forever stay.\" The crown was made of gold! Did it mean that they didn’t need the crown? \"Well, have you found the crown yet, Mortal?\" the immortal’s voice slammed through her head. Taking a deep breath before remembering that she didn’t have to speak, Oriana silently explained her theory about the riddle’s last line. \"You are correct, unfortunately. The crown is only a symbol of power and of greed.\" The immortal sighed, \"I cannot give you the crown. It was destroyed long ago. However, I can give you this.\" He handed her a golden flame. It didn’t burn or radiate heat; it just glowed. The flame tickled and was too bright to stare at for very long. \"It is the Flame of Guilt. Give it to someone who has unjustly wronged you, and watch the flame. Use it quickly, for like everything else gold, it will not last long.\" The voice had been getting softer and softer. Oriana’s last conscious thought before falling asleep was, \"I’m home in my bed.\" Desdemona was furious when a maid came running to her room, shrieking that the princess was home. It didn’t help that her plan to be the center of attention had failed. She had thought that with Oriana out of the way, the entire court would love her. On the contrary, the people hated her even more because there was no one to cheer them as Oriana had. Stalking angrily to her throne, Desdemona waited for her niece to bring her the crown. At least with the crown she would be extremely powerful and could perhaps get rid of the little brat once and for all. She continued to think in this vein for some time and didn’t realize that Oriana was in the room until a courtier announced her. Oriana stood quietly for a moment, studying her aunt. Then she opened her left hand. The golden flame twined round her fingers and blazed in her palm, lighting the entire gathering. The court watched breathlessly as she began to speak. \"I did not find the crown. It was destroyed long ago. The immortal who stole it, however, gave me this as a reward for using his clues to solve the mystery.\" She gestured at the flame. \"I would like to give it to my aunt as a gift, for being so kind as to trust me with this quest.\" Oriana’s musical voice paused, and she added, \"Please, Aunt, accept my gift.\" Desdemona was suspicious, but her greedy nature took command. \"Yes, my dear,\" her face showing disgust as she said it, \"I will accept your flame.\" \"There is a condition, my aunt. Only one who is pure of heart may hold the Flame of Guilt. If someone unworthy touches it, she will spend the rest of her life as a servant in the Faerie Court.\" Oriana searched her aunt’s face. Desdemona was horrified. If she refused to take it, the court would think she had done something evil. If she took it, the entire court would know she had done evil. She said, \"Of course, you know you are putting me into a rather awkward position, dear Oriana. I shall need to consult with my personal psychic prior to accepting your gift; but rest assured,\" she continued, an evil gleam in her eye, \"justice will prevail.\" Desdemona summoned the court psychic and huddled with him as everyone looked on with great anticipation. A terrible frown overcame her face, and she screamed, \"Get out! You know nothing!\" Then she approached Oriana, and, resigning herself to a life waiting on picky, irritating little faeries, she took the flame. Desdemona began to fade and, with one last look of disgust at Oriana, disappeared, never to be seen again. That night, a blissfully happy princess looked out her window, expecting to see the usual suffocating blackness. Instead, she saw that the silver stone at the center of her necklace and all of the other beads and gems were gleaming in the sky. It was beautiful. That is the tale of how Oriana conquered the night, How the stars came to shine so bright. How she planted the moon and stars as beads, And revealed Desdemona’s evil deeds."
6, "Linden’s Library  It was a normal Saturday on Oak Street—the same morning dew sparkling on the grass, the same cherry blossoms swaying in the breeze, the same daffodils bursting with color. Yes, as far as anyone could tell, it was a normal day in Washington, D.C. When Katie awoke, she got dressed, brushed her teeth and hair, and checked her \"to do\" list. Then she hurried down for breakfast: rich, fluffy, chocolate-chip pancakes; fresh orange juice; crispy bacon; and crunchy, buttered toast. Katie’s stomach growled loudly. \"Smells good, Mom,\" Katie said. \"Good morning!\" her mother chimed happily. \"Eat up. You sound like you’re starving to death!\" Katie sat down and ate. \"So what’s on the agenda today, Katie?\" \"Today I have the Library Club with June and Cat,\" Katie said. As soon as she finished eating, she scraped her plate (even though there was barely a crumb on it) and went outside. Katie loved everything to do with nature. She wanted to be an environmentalist when she grew up. She sat in her favorite spot under the massive cherry tree, where she had a spectacular view of the Washington Monument. Before heading to the library, she thought of what to do with her week of spring break. As Katie sat down on the rug of Linden’s Library with her best friends June and Cat (short for Catherine), she noticed a new book on the table. Its title was Wild Safari. When the librarian said they could pick their books, Katie ran to the table and snatched the book before anyone else could. Then she walked over to the checkout counter, where Linden stood. Linden was a tall, lanky man with blazing blue eyes that were strangely magnified by his green glasses. He had brown hair styled in a stubbly crew cut. He was about 35 years old, Katie thought. Most of the time he was cheery, and he always told the truth. \"Hello, Katie,\" he said. \"Hi, Linden,\" said Katie. \"I was wondering if I could check out this new book.\" She showed him Wild Safari. \"I wouldn’t take that book, Katie,\" Linden said. \"Why?\" asked Katie. \"Because if you take that book, bad things will happen,\" Linden said. Katie gave him a puzzled look. \"What kind of things?\" she asked. \"I don’t know, but they’ll be bad,\" Linden warned. \"Well, will you still allow me to check out the book?\" Katie asked. \"Yes, but only because I think I know how to stop the bad stuff if it does happen,\" Linden replied. So Katie checked out the book and went to find June and Cat. She saw that June was holding The Long Winter and Cat had The Secret Garden. Katie shared with them every word of her conversation with Linden. \"That’s odd,\" said June. \"Normally he tells the truth, but I think he’s trying to scare you. After all, it’s only a book, right?\" But somehow her words didn’t convince Katie. Katie’s thoughts were unsettled, so she went to her favorite spot, where she could always make sense of things. She sat down under the tree and started to read the book. It was full of jungle animal adventures—everything from anteaters to zebras. After reading three chapters, she brought the book inside and put it on her nightstand. That evening, after eating a scrumptious dinner, Katie went to her room to change into her pj’s. She went to the living room to watch TV with her family, and then she retreated to her room so she could read more. When she got to the ninth chapter, she fell asleep. That’s when the madness began. When Katie woke up, her world was upside-down. Everything in sight was covered in ivy, and it seemed to be growing out of her book! She grabbed desperately for some scissors and went outside. The landscape couldn’t have been more different. All of Washington was covered with ivy—even the Washington Monument! She ran back inside and jumped on her mom to wake her up. When her mom opened her eyes, she screamed, which woke up her dad, who also screamed. They seemed to be frozen with fear! Katie decided that they were no help, so she ran to her friend June’s house. They were just waking up and didn’t see the ivy because it wasn’t inside their house. They were all shocked to see Katie there and wondered why she looked so flustered. \"Look outside,\" she said in little more than a whisper. They all went outside, and their reaction was the same as Katie’s parents. June was the only one who didn’t freeze with fear. \"June,\" Katie said, \"do you have any clue how this happened?\" \"No,\" June said, trembling, \"but let’s think over the conversation you had with Linden.\" \"Good thinking,\" said Katie. They went to June’s room and talked for an hour. Finally, Katie remembered that Linden had said that he knew how to stop the bad stuff if it happened. \"Let’s pay him a visit,\" said June. They both ran to Linden’s house. They could tell everything was getting worse—animals were everywhere, and the ivy was getting thicker. They had to cut the ivy with Katie’s scissors just to ring the doorbell at Linden’s house! When he answered the door, Katie asked, \"Can we stop it?\" Linden said just one word before he fainted. The word was \"shred.\" \"He must mean shred the book!\" Katie said. She and June ran as fast as they could to Katie’s house and tried to find their way through the thick ivy to the book. When they eventually got to the book, Katie and June beat and shredded the book until it let out a strange shriek, sucked in all the ivy and animals that had escaped its pages, and vanished. No one except Katie and June knew what really happened that eerie day. To this day, they still look for the mysterious book. Who knows where it will appear next . . . ?" 
6, "My Backyard  My backyard breathes life! The plants gather the sunlight with bending and reaching arms. Trailing vines hold onto the fences with curling fingers. The tall grasses and ferns dance around the garden. A hummingbird rapidly flutters, waving good morning as she drinks the nectar from the shining smiles of colorful flower heads. The wind whispers as she passes, telling me everything she has seen as she softly lays down the seeds she has carried."
6, "The Call  The telephone rings endlessly. This is insane! Anxiety hits my stomach, Then rises up through my body. Will he pick up? Butterflies roar. Does he care? Oh, no . . . Breathe. Click. Someone’s there. Who? His sister maybe? No. It’s him . . . I can’t think straight. Click. I hope— no, wish (wishing is more desperate) that he can go. Ask. Now! Click.  The words spill out, like a reaction, without thinking. Where is the nervousness? Gone. His voice is muffled outside of the phone. He is asking. Please let him come. I pray a thousand times in one second. He can come! My hand puts the phone down. AAAHHH! I scream as I let everything out. I throw my arms around my friend . . . The ultimate girly moment. Wait. Another problem. What am I going to wear?"
6, "I Am Latvia  In the beginning, my people were primitive, and they used my resources to survive. They used stone, and then bronze and iron for tools. They traded with other peoples from afar, beyond my reaches. They became clever and prosperous; they built permanent homes for themselves. I was happy. I am beautiful. I stretch from the Baltic Sea to the southern Daugava River, and the lands within are rich. Or, at least, they once were . . . before the invaders came. But my lands had contained riches, of dolomite and lumber, and most of all, of amber. Amber, the ancient tree sap that had turned to rock over time, had become more precious than gold. My people traded amber gathered along my coasts to places around the vast world, and became very rich. They farmed the land and grew grain and flax. Their meals were simple but wholesome. Some special foods were kisels, eaten only on holidays, and putras, a porridge of barley and oats. Their lives were simple. Then the first invaders came. They called themselves the Teutonic Knights, or Knights of the Sword. They attacked my people, destroying whole towns! Our warriors tried to fight but were slaughtered by the advanced weapons of our conquerors. Soon, they had taken away my lands, and they began to convert my people to a new religion called Catholicism. One of the knights founded Riga, my capital city, and the jewel of my land. Unfortunately, my people were horribly oppressed under the harsh Teutonic rule. And so it continued. The Teutonics were overthrown by the Polish, the Polish were overthrown by the Lithuanians, the Lithuanians were overthrown by the Russians. My people were always second-class citizens, never independent, never given their own identity. And yet, in some places, the old ways remained, and my people held on. The \"St. Petersburg Paper\" was published in Riga from 1862-1865. It created some of the earliest feelings of nationalism among my people. Its main editors were Krisjanis Barons and Krisjanis Valdemars. Written only a little later, in 1873, was the Latvian National Anthem (considered so 50 years before Latvia would become a country), \"Dievs Svcti Latviyu,\" or \"God Bless Latvia.\" Time passed. The Germans captured my country next and made my people into slaves. Then, once again, it was the Russians! I wondered if it would ever end. But I had been in existence for a long time, and I was patient. Finally, after nearly 900 years since my people had been independent at all, a Great War broke out throughout the land. The Russians, who were the rulers, had a revolution, and lost their hold on my people in 1918. We became independent! I was so proud of them. A president was elected, and my people recovered, multiplied, and prospered once more. Later, the government of my people became corrupt. A man named Karlis Ulmanis declared a state of emergency and took it over. He was a dictator, but a benevolent one, and he saved the government from collapse. My country began to become one of the richest in the land. But disaster struck again. Another Great War began, and we were attacked by the Russians. Our armies, despite being untrained, fought better than they did, but still they outnumbered us. They pushed my people back until the only ones still fighting were trapped in a castle in the center of Riga. Then they, too, fell. The Russians had a new form of government called Communism. They took away all the farms and made them into huge, collectivized impersonal farms, where my people slaved away to live. Then the Germans and the Russians fought, with both sides burning my fields and killing my people. We were caught in the middle, and we couldn’t get out. In the end, the Russians \"won\" control over us. They polluted my air, land, and water with foul toxins in the name of \"industrialization.\" And so we were ruled, for nearly another 50 years. My people wanted independence, for, beyond the bad treatment of their land, the Russians had no similar culture. Not even their language or alphabet was the same! My people use a Roman alphabet, and the Russians use Cyrillic. My people speak Lettish, a language totally different than Russian. Then things finally began to change. The Russian government began to weaken. My people, allied with people of the neighboring lands of Estonia and Lithuania, spoke out against the Russians. Protesters formed a human chain across the three countries. The Freedom Movement in Riga, a giant statue of a person holding three five-pointed stars, was sculpted by Elmars Rudzitis at this time. When the Russian government collapsed, we were officially granted independence! The new government was a democracy. The president and Prime Minister were elected, and so was the 100-seat Saeima, or parliament. Many political parties sprang up. There was much to recover from, but my people still had their culture and their heritage. Without the supplies that the Russians had made my people dependent on, there was less money and fewer jobs. And cleaning up the pollution was a huge job. But my people struggled through it. Slowly the economy began to improve, and my people began to manufacture goods to be sent to other lands. Some of the old way of life resumed when the farms were de-collectivized, and freedom grew. Many aspects of my people’s culture live on. The dainas, which were sacred four-line poems/songs, are still known today. My people are very fond of singing. Since 1876, they have held the Latvian Song Festival, where thousands of people go to sing and dance. It has gone on every five years since then. Folk dances are very popular, too. Many of my people still wear the national costume, which is a traditional suit for men, and a brightly woven skirt over a white blouse for women. Women also sometimes wear glittery golden headbands. Traditional instruments that are played are the stringed kokle, the reed stabule, and the percussion trejdeksnis. Much song and dance goes on during the holidays. During Ziemas Zvetki, or Winter Holiday, everyone sings of the sun soon to be returning to warm my lands. Though I exist far to the north, the Atlantic Current flows into the Baltic Sea and keeps me warm. Jani, or St. John’s Day, is a holiday where people sing and chant all night to ward off evil spirits. Men and women wear wreaths of wildflowers, and this holiday brings together the ancient Earth-worshipping beliefs and the newer Christian ones. During the Russian occupation, my people were often not allowed to practice any religions, and nearly all my people who were Jewish were killed when the Germans came through. Now, though, many religions are flourishing, and religious tolerance is practiced. The Coat of Arms is a symbol of myself and my people. On it are a red lion that symbolizes the southern half of my lands, and a white griffin that symbolizes the northern half. A ribbon ties the two halves together. In the last millenium, my people had only been independent for 40 total years. But this time, they were going to hold on to their freedom and national pride. And so, I sit back and watch them. I am proud of my people, they have accomplished much in the face of terrible odds. They are a beautiful people in a beautiful land. I have seen them. And I remember."
6, "Mir Pushed the Frontier of Space  Before the International Space Station, the largest structure in space was the Mir space station. The Soviets (and Russians) built Mir in orbit from 1986 to 1996. The station lasted another five years before its orbit decayed and it burned up on re-entry in 2001. As the first modular space station, Mir pushed the frontiers of science, but as a result, living conditions inside weren't glamorous. Mir astronauts were more like the early pioneers who risked their lives but kept going and made their mission a success. Mir’s struggles began with the space station itself. By 1998, Mir had already made its 69,560th orbit of the earth. That’s 1.83 billion miles! In addition to having high mileage, Mir had a computer system that was ancient. Since Mir blasted off in 1986, astronauts had to fix more than 1,500 problems on the ship. Most were small, but a few were big. In February 1997, a fire shut down an oxygen generator. Then in June 1997, a spaceship carrying supplies to Mir crashed into a solar panel (Chien 97). Many times, the crew sat in the dark because there wasn’t enough power to work the computers or do experiments. Like the pioneers who headed west in covered wagons, Mir astronauts learned to do the best they could with what they had. For example, Mir astronauts wore their cotton T-shirts, gym shorts, and socks for two weeks! The astronauts wore the clothes day and night and even exercised in them. After two weeks, astronauts just pitched the stinky stuff into space where it burned up in the earth’s atmosphere (Hoversten). Life on Mir could be downright unhealthy. The humid air made mold grow, and the mold spoiled the food. The crew couldn't wash well, and infections spread quickly, especially when new astronauts came on board. After their bodies were weightless for a long time, the bones in their lower hips and spines got weaker (Chien 99). Then, when astronauts went back to Earth, they had more problems. They had poor balance, weak muscles, and severe soreness (Covault 76). The living conditions on Mir would've made even Captain Kirk return to Earth. Fans hummed nonstop. The smell of gasoline hung in the air, and food was served up freeze-dried. The shower often was broken, so the crew had to take sponge baths. Even sleeping was hard. Jerry Linenger spent 132 days on Mir with these problems. He said, \"There’s something about it [life on Mir] that makes you feel, ‘Yeah, I’m on the frontier’ \" (Hoversten). Even though life on Mir wasn’t glamorous and equipment often failed, the Mir astronauts had lots of success. Like the pioneers, the astronauts found many useful things that helped explorers who followed them. But maybe Mir’s greatest success was that astronauts from Russia and the U.S., two old enemies, worked together as friends (Chien 99)."
6, "The Aloha State  More than any other state, Hawaii is world famous for its beauty and pleasant climate. This is probably why Hawaii, the \"Aloha State,\" is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, and why I would love to visit this state someday. Besides being a great place for tourists, though, Hawaii is also a great place to live and has over one million residents. Hawaii is made up entirely of islands and is located in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The closest of its islands to the U.S. mainland is about 2,091 miles southwest of San Francisco. Hawaii is the youngest of the 50 states; it joined the union in 1959. The state of Hawaii has a mixed population of Japanese, Filipino, Polynesian, and Chinese. The people are proud that their state is a community with many different backgrounds. Many people are mixtures of several nationalities and races. More than four-fifths of its people live in urban areas, mostly in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. The climate in Hawaii is mild throughout the year with little difference between the hottest and coldest month. Honolulu, for example, has a normal daily temperature of 72 degrees in January and 80 degrees in July. Precipitation is uneven throughout the year because of the surrounding water. Usual precipitation for the year is about 480 inches of rainfall. However, Honolulu receives only 23 inches annually, most of it falling between November and March. Tourism is the leading money maker in this beautiful state, with service industries accounting for 87 percent of Hawaii’s gross state product (the total value of goods and services produced in a state in a year). Each year, the islands attract over three million visitors. Oahu is the leading destination for most tourists. The state’s warm climate and its fine sand beaches are the leading attractions, as are the many top golf courses. There are also other attractions to visit in Hawaii, like Haleakala National Park on Maui and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park contains two active volcanoes at the present time. In this park is Mauna Loa, the world’s largest volcano. This park is about 229,000 acres in area. It was created in 1961 and extends eastward from the summit of Mauna Loa to the Pacific Ocean, passing a 30-mile section of the coast. Mauna Loa is 13,677 feet above sea level. Its submerged portion rises 20,000 feet above the seafloor. Kilauea, the park’s other active volcano, rises from the eastern flank of Mauna Loa to an elevation of just over 4,000 feet. Haleakala National Park boasts Haleakala Crater, the world’s largest inactive volcanic crater. It measures about 20 miles around and is about 3,000 feet deep. Another great thing to do in Hawaii besides sightseeing would be fishing. The fishing industry is very small in the state, although it is expanding. Some major types of fish caught there are yellowfin and skipjack tuna. It would be easy to communicate while visiting Hawaii because almost all of the people speak English. But they frequently use some of the more musical words of the Hawaiian language in their speech. For example, they call tourists \"malihini,\" meaning newcomer. Another familiar Hawaiian word is \"aloha,\" which means love, greetings, welcome, and farewell. They also communicate through their \"hula,\" which means dance. These dances tell stories about the islands. Hawaiian music uses steel guitars and the ukelele, which means \"leaping flea.\" One of Hawaii’s only problems is transportation. Most goods have to be shipped by air or sea, so things are very expensive. Airlines are the quickest and easiest way to travel in Hawaii. But travel within the state is expensive because the islands are widely separated. The biggest airport is the Honolulu International. Another problem is keeping the islands beautiful with all of the increased tourist business. Tourists spend over $4 billion in Hawaii each year, but the people who live there don’t want all of these people destroying the natural beauty of their homeland. Despite the problems of transportation and increased tourism, Hawaii is still a great place to visit or live because of the warm climate and the beauty of the islands. There are also many amazing things to do and see on this group of islands. Every American should visit Hawaii at least once in his or her life."
6, "The Incredible Egg Procedure: On October 5, I gathered a large Styrofoam cup, an egg, some vinegar, some corn syrup, and some water. Before I started the lab, I weighed the egg on a scale. Because the egg would just roll off the scale if I set it down by itself, I weighed the cup, and then added the egg. After I knew how much the egg weighed, I poured enough vinegar in the cup to submerge the egg. I then covered the top of the cup with plastic wrap and set the egg aside. The next day, I washed the egg and the cup and weighed the egg. Then I poured in enough corn syrup to cover the egg, and I once again covered the cup with plastic wrap and set it aside. The third and final day of this lab, I cleaned the egg and the cup and weighed the egg again. For the last part of the experiment, I covered the egg with water, put plastic wrap over the cup, and set it aside, following up the next day with another weigh-in. Observations: After letting the egg sit in vinegar for 24 hours, the hard part of the shell had been eaten off. The part of the soft shell that was left was very smooth and slimy. The egg weighed a little less than the day before because the heaviest part of the shell was gone. The egg also had a small dent in it because the outside was so fragile. When I tried to wash off the extra vinegar, I almost dropped the egg because it was so slippery. On the second day, when I washed off the corn syrup, the egg was very light. It had numerous dents in it, and it was so fragile that I could barely wash it off. The egg was very slippery and extremely slimy, but I managed to hold on. It felt like I was holding a blown-up balloon in my hand—that’s how light the egg was. On the third day, when I took the egg out of the water, I found that it was a little bit heavier than the day before. There were not as many dents in the egg, so it was much easier to wash off. The egg was still a little bit slippery and kind of slimy, but overall, it was in much better shape than the day before. Conclusions: I discovered that the shell peeled off in the vinegar because of an acidic reaction. The acid in the vinegar peeled away the shell. When the egg was soft and light from the corn syrup, it was because water had left the egg to cause a state of equilibrium. The water had made the egg heavy and somewhat sturdy. When the egg was in the water, the water diffused into the egg to cause a state of equilibrium, and that is why the egg was heavier on that day. I really had a fun time experimenting with my egg. I learned a lot about diffusion and equilibrium."
6, "Unique Wolves  If you visit northern Wisconsin, don't be surprised to hear the eerie and beautiful howl of wolves at night. They have returned after about 40 years of absence. By the 1950's, wolves had been driven out of their ancient homeland by ranchers and the federal government. Wolves killed livestock for food, so they were considered nuisances. But starting in the 1990's, the state reintroduced wolves to help manage the deer population. The number of wolves has now rebounded to nearly a thousand. Wolves are relatives to coyotes, foxes, jackals, dingoes, and our pet dogs. Some people mistake wolves and coyotes, but wolves are much larger and stockier. A wolf is like a German shepherd except with longer legs, bigger feet, a wider head, and a long, bushy tail. Like a dog, a wolf has very good vision, smell, and hearing, which allow it to track and kill caribou, deer, elk, and moose. Wolves sometimes eat 20 pounds of meat at one time with their 42 teeth. Wolves hunt mainly at night and early in the morning. At birth, a wolf pup weighs one pound. At three weeks, pups start to eat meat. Each spring, wolves have six to fourteen pups, which are born in dens. A den can be a cave, the hollow trunk of a tree, a hole that the mother dug, or a thicket. Wolf packs have eight to twenty members. The leader, called the alpha male, always gets food first, and if anyone butts in, they get growled and snarled at. Wolves communicate by howling, tail actions, and mouth actions. When wolves can’t find food, they eat leftovers from other kills that they have buried, but they can go several weeks without food. Packs need 100 to 250 square miles to live in. Wolves can run up to 24 miles per hour. Most animals they hunt can run faster, but wolves can run tirelessly for hours and can leap as high as one-story buildings. Wolves used to live all over North America, Europe, and Asia, but after the 1950’s wolf populations survived only in northern Minnesota and Alaska in the United States, in Canada, northern Europe, and northern Asia. Now they are making a comeback in other areas because scientists recognize their important role as apex predators. Wolves can live in any type of climate except for the desert and the highest mountains. Their color varies from pure white to jet black, depending on where they live. Wolves are fun to watch and listen to. Now that wolves are starting to move back into some of the lower 48 states, you might hear them howl again."
6, "To: Heidi Larson Dear Dr. Larson: Your accountant, Rusty Silhacek, is my neighbor. He mentioned that your office stays very busy, so I wondered if you could use some extra help. I would like to apply for a position as a part-time veterinary assistant. As far as animal care goes, I’m experienced in feeding, bathing, exercising, and cleaning up after small and large animals.

I would be happy to come in for an interview at your convenience. You can contact me any weekday after 3:00 p.m. at 523-4418. Thank you for considering my application. Sincerely, Andrea Rodriguez"
6, "A Lesson to Learn  My little brother is so irritating. All day long he says, \"Eddie, I wonder why people can talk but animals can’t.\" Or, \"I wonder why the ocean looks blue.\" Of course, I don’t know the answers, but I don’t let him know that. I just make up reasonable explanations, and he accepts them as if I’m the smartest person in the world. Before I answer one of his questions, I usually tell him that he’s pretty stupid and asks too many questions. Well, yesterday we both got our report cards. I got B’s and C’s, and he got straight A’s. Under the \"Comments\" section on my report card, it said, \"Eddie would be getting better grades if he asked more questions.\" Of course, on my brother’s report card, it said just the opposite. To make things worse, my brother squawked all day about how I was so stupid for not asking questions! I just sighed and told him he was right—I wouldn't make fun of him anymore for asking so many questions. Yes, I learned a lesson from my little brother: Never be afraid to ask questions, and NEVER be afraid to wonder why."
9, "Caught in the Net  \"Hello. My name is Kim. I’m an online-aholic.\" There. I’ve said it. I guess I’ve been addicted for quite some time now, but I have just begun to realize it. My first interaction with the \"Net\" began when I was only 15 years old. My dad was the computer coordinator at our school, so he wanted to try Internet access at home before installing it at school. We became America Online members in 1993. None of my friends had email back then. My relationship with email started like a Romeo/Juliet conspiracy. I experimented with the Net on the sly at night when the rest of my family was sleeping. That’s when I first created my own screen name. Although I was too young to drive, the locked doors of adolescence were suddenly flung open before me. I could be social in the evening rather than hang out with my family—the typical family that every adolescent wants to escape from. Hanging out in chat rooms became a nightly ritual. I quickly found friends who would meet me there, give advice for my adolescent problems, and discuss things such as dating, theater, religion, morals, and entertainment. I began to form emotional attachments with these new friends. In fact, I maintained two online relationships for over two years. Raul is a Hispanic teenager living in one of the roughest cities in our nation, Compton, California—the filming location of the 1991 movie Boyz ’N the Hood. I met Raul in a chat room one night. He sent me an instant message in the middle of a discussion about religion and asked what I believed. My subsequent chats with Raul seemed to have an impact on him and helped me to grow in my own faith. I occasionally took Raul’s questions to my preacher or Bible teacher when I needed further explanation. For Raul’s 18th birthday, I sent him a Bible that I bought with my paper-route earnings. Raul and I wrote each other for two years, and then Raul had to sell his computer. I haven’t heard from him since. Brian is a middle-aged high-school theater teacher in Bowie, Maryland. He answered one of my message board posts about an upcoming audition for our school’s performance of The Sound of Music. I was 17 years old at the time and greatly desired a part in the musical. Brian had expert advice for how to nail the audition, and as a result I was cast in the role of Maria. Needless to say, we began to communicate regularly via email. My high school drama director had very little experience, so I wrote Brian regarding my struggles with developing character. Brian has written on numerous occasions about coming to see me perform, but it hasn’t happened yet. Instead I mail him videos of my performances. We have been writing for four years now, and I never perform without reading advice from him before going on stage. To this day, he is still my mentor, even though I’ve never seen a picture of him or heard his voice. Perhaps communicating with my new friends wouldn’t have been so bad except that I went online nightly. I remember my mom coming out of her bedroom at 2:00 a.m., her eyes unaccustomed to the light, her hair tousled from sleep, and her robe wrapped tightly around her cold, sluggish body. \"What are you still doing up?\" she would ask. \"Go to bed!\" Now that I’m 20 years old and in college, not much has changed. I still stay up late writing email, only now I don’t have anyone to tell me to \"go to bed!\" I can disguise my Internet addiction by going to a computer center and frantically typing away at a computer terminal. Little does everyone else know how often I’m not doing school research or paper writing; instead I’m aimlessly writing emails or chatting with Internet friends and family hundreds of miles away. The Signs I recently took an online \"Internet Addiction Test\" to diagnose the severity of my problem. The test included 10 symptoms of Internet addiction. I evaluated each symptom carefully and related it to my own life. Uses online services everyday without any skipping. Well, yes, this is true. The first thing I do when I wake up every morning is log on and check my email. I have a daily electronic newspaper and weather report waiting for me (delivered at 7:30 a.m. just like our tangible newspaper at home). My computer stays logged on all day, and the last thing I do before I go to bed is check my email again, just in case there’s a message waiting for me. I figure, Why let an email wait unopened when I could just as well read it now? Loses track of time after making a connection. This is true of me also. Just the other day I sat down by my computer after classes were done for the day. I had an hour before choir, and a whole pile of reading that needed to be done. I’ll just quickly check my mail, I thought, and then I’ll do my reading. Instead, I ended up doing email and Internet browsing for the entire hour and was even two minutes late for choir. Countless times I’ve said \"only one more minute\" to myself or to friends who ask how much longer I’ll be playing on the computer—but quite often that \"minute\" turns into hours. Goes out less and less. Not true. I still have a very active social life. Perhaps I spend less time on homework due to Internet use, but not less time socializing. Spends less and less time on meals at home or at work, and eats in front of the monitor. Occasionally I eat my lunch in front of my computer—but that’s just good time management, isn’t it? On these occasions, I am pressed for time to get to my next class, so I eat and do my email at the same time. There is the small problem of crumbs falling into the keyboard or greasy fingers brushing the tops of the keys, but I don’t worry about these things when I want to check my email. Denies spending too much time on the Net. What? I don’t spend too much time on the Net! Others complain that you spend too much time in front of the monitor. At home, my mom often complained about my time in front of the monitor. While my family watched football around the TV on Sunday afternoons, I had personal chats with friends online. Now that I’m away from home, my roommates tease me about my time online. But I acknowledge that I do spend twice (maybe three or four times) as much time online as do all of my other friends and roommates. Checks the electronic mailbox too many times a day. I estimate that I check my email 20-30 times throughout the day. Quite often it’s just out of habit when I enter or exit my room—it’s so easy to click the \"Get mail\" button. Perhaps it’s too accessible for me. I can check my email as a study break in the middle of an assignment, or when I have 10 extra minutes before class. My friends ask if I get discouraged when I check and don’t have mail. I don’t. Sure, I’d like to see new mail appear rather than \"No new messages on server,\" but maybe I’m used to it by now. With an average of 10 messages received per day, I’m used to not having email every time I check. Thinks he or she has the greatest Web site in the world, and dies to give people the URL (Internet address). Nope, not me. I don’t have my own Web site. (But if I knew how to create one, I think I’d be interested.) Logs onto the Net while already busy at work. In regard to schoolwork, yes, I check my email or go to the Internet several times while busy on other assignments. I find that my Internet use is most frequent when I’m procrastinating over an urgent assignment or when I’m waiting for an idea to \"hit me.\" I dodge the pressure of schoolwork by exercising the power I have online to communicate with others or locate mountains of useless information. Sneaks online with a sense of relief when spouse or family members are not at home. Not anymore. I’m pretty open with my time online. However, I do find myself secretly hoping that other people think I’m studious—doing homework—rather than writing another measly email. Cold Turkey The results of this \"Internet Addiction Test\" indicated that I answered yes to 7 of the 10 symptoms and \"may very well be addicted to the Net.\" I was shocked! Sure, I spend more time online than most other people I know do, but I never realized that my time on the computer could become an addiction. It was at this point that essayist Askold Melnyczuk’s words hit home: \"Technology is addicting: the habit is hard to break. Like heroin, it feeds on our wish to escape the limits of time and space; and it consumes us.\" In response to this discovery, I decided to take a 24-hour break from the Net—a standstill on email, instant messages and Web surfing. I told my roommates of my decision and found a sign affixed to my computer screen the next day, holding me to my word: \"Stay strong, my friend! 24 hours is only one day. You can do it! The clock is tickin’! NO EMAIL marathon. The messages will still be there…\" It wasn’t easy going cold turkey. Every time I walked into my bedroom, my hands instantly clenched as that obtrusive sign prevented me from taking a minute to \"Get mail.\" While I did go to bed earlier—not allowing myself to check for the latest arriving messages at 1:00 a.m.—I hated this moratorium, and I complained about it to my roommates. When the 24 hours were finally up, I ran back to my room and clicked on my cherished \"Get mail\" to find 12 new messages waiting. After this 24-hour marathon, I realized that I had real friends in cyberspace. Without the Internet, I compromised my ability to stay in touch with these people. I enjoy communicating through instant messages with my mom and brothers. Just the other night I had three small windows on my screen: one from my brother in California, one from my brother here at college with me, and one from my mom. I was able to chat with all three at the same time—for free! I guess I’m just not quite ready to go cold turkey. Final Evaluation I wonder how many frequent Internet users have taken time to evaluate how the technology has impacted their personal lives. I wonder how many of those who have considered its impact have permanently pulled the plug, cut the wire, and tossed out the computer, and how many others, like myself, took a short vacation, then ran back to the sleeping monitor. Like me, many college students are attracted to the unrestricted, free, and unlimited Internet access available on campuses across the nation. Psychologist Kimberly Young of the University of Pittsburgh-Bradford said, \"College counselors are starting to see those students who can’t stop surfing the Net at the risk of jeopardizing their grades.\" So far, my problem has not become this big. My grades are not slipping, and I am not in need of counseling. I admit that I’m addicted to spending time on the computer, and it is difficult for me to go without it. Yet I refuse to completely reject the medium just because my use of it is somewhat irrational. The Internet provides me with a practical form of communication and offers an easily accessible source of information. I enjoy spending time online. I have not substituted Internet relationships for real-life relationships, and my Internet addiction is not a threat to my financial and emotional security, so I don’t see a problem with it. However, if I ever do find that I’ve gone over the edge, I know I can email Dr. Young at her Web site (www.addictionrecov.org). Or I can go to a weekly meeting place for Internet addicts, a chat channel called Addictions.com. After all, Internet junkies always know where to turn online for help."
9, "From Bed Bound to Breaking Boards She had finally gotten her green belt in Tae Kwando. It was an amazing accomplishment for Kameelah D., a thin African American girl standing about five feet tall. Only four years before, she was told by a doctor that she would never walk again. It was quite evident that not only would she walk again, but she would also run, jump, kick, and punch. When Kameelah was 11, a routine physical uncovered an abnormal curvature in her spine. It was soon after diagnosed as scoliosis. Kameelah, as well as her family, was devastated. They were told by the doctor that only 10 percent of all children are afflicted by scoliosis, but her family just couldn’t believe Kameelah was a part of that 10 percent. Her first surgery was scheduled immediately. The doctor had the difficult task of reconstructing Kameelah’s entire spine and then re-situating her organs around it. \"I had never been in the hospital for anything serious before, and I’d never had surgery, either. I was so scared,\" Kameelah recalls. She was given something to fall asleep for the surgery, so that she would not feel anything. Because this surgery dealt with the vertebrae and nerve connections to the brain, the doctor had to make sure that Kameelah could still move her body parts right. Therefore, she was awakened in the middle of the surgery. \"They would ask me to move my fingers, then my toes. I could barely comprehend what was going on. It was bright, and things weren’t very clear. In retrospect, I can’t believe that I was awake while my back was split open, and the doctors had their hands in there.\" The first surgery was successful, but Kameelah would have to return two more times for the doctor to completely fix the problem. It was at the end of the third surgery when things went wrong . . . really wrong. The doctor inserted a metal rod, which happened to be too small, into Kameelah’s back. As a result, it compressed some of the nerves in her spine. She was practically paralyzed from the waist down. \"I’m really very sorry but . . . I don’t think Kameelah will ever be able to walk again,\" the doctor informed her parents. But Kameelah’s father, James, as well as Kameelah herself, refused to accept that prediction. Her father, a registered nurse, insisted that the doctor put her in physical therapy and try to rehabilitate her. He insisted that he be there, too, along with the therapist, helping to rehabilitate his daughter. But the doctor wouldn’t oblige. He said that it was a lost cause, and that he knew that Kameelah could never walk again. \"I was really scared. I just remember telling Dad, ‘I have to walk. I have to walk, Dad.’ And he promised me, he swore to me, that I would walk again. He said just what I needed to hear.\" James kept his promise. He brought Kameelah home in a wheelchair and worked with her, doing exercises that would have been ridiculously easy for any other person, but that were excruciatingly difficult for Kameelah. After about a year, Kameelah was miraculously able to walk with a walker. In no time, she even got strong enough to get along without the walker. Eventually, she walked confidently, and even ran steadily. Now, at the age of twenty-two, she can execute a flying sidekick with the greatest of ease. \"Not bad for someone who was told she would never walk again, huh?\" she jokes."
9, "If Only They Knew Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that I struggled with for the majority of my middle school years and a portion of my high school years. My classmates at Riverview High School were aware of my disorder, and it greatly affected the way they treated me. At the start of my junior year, I transferred to Madison High School. I decided not to tell anyone at that school about my eating disorder since I was mostly recovered by that time. Even though my friends at Riverview and Madison all showed concern for my well-being, their approaches differed greatly, especially in lunchroom behavior, conversation, and individual opinions about my personality and character. At Riverview, lunchtime was usually a nightmare for me. I would enter the cafeteria, and in my mind, all eyes would fix themselves upon my gangly figure. I would take my place at a table full of friends and try to enjoy a \"normal\" lunch. The problem was that I would not always eat lunch, and that greatly concerned my friends. They would watch to make sure that I was eating properly, almost forcing food into my mouth. Sometimes I would pretend to eat and then drop pieces of food into a napkin and throw it out with the trash. When some of my friends found out, they were furious, which seemed to cause even more trouble. Lunch was obviously not my favorite time of the day, and it involved a lot of stress. Strangely, I stopped dreading lunch when I started at Madison. No one knew that I had an eating disorder, so they did not care what I ate. This lifted an enormous amount of stress from my life. I finally had the freedom to eat what I wanted without being harassed. It was still hard for me to eat in front of other people, which is common for anorexics, but I was able to put some of my fears aside. I began to enjoy lunch instead of disposing of it. With my Riverview friends, instead of chatting about boys and other \"girl things,\" we would discuss my disorder. Girls would follow me into the bathroom, and instead of styling their hair, they would check to see if I was throwing up. We never got to gossip together like normal middle-school girls because we had to focus on anorexia instead. All I really wanted to talk about was how cute Mike Reynolds looked that day. I was totally shocked to find that all the life-and-death conversations disappeared when I went to Madison. It was so much fun to talk about the little things that occurred in everyday life. The subject of eating disorders rarely came up, and when it did, I was not the focus. I loved having the freedom to go into the bathroom without being followed. High school is meant to be filled with frivolous chatter, and at Madison I participated in more than my fair share. I found that the students at Riverview had made many generalizations about my character, and their behavior was guided by those generalizations. Their natural instincts told them to help me. I appreciated their concern, but they never took the time to find out who I was as a person. They knew me only as an anorexic. My friends cared about my health, but they failed to care about me. Truthfully, all I wanted was for them to love me for me and not to obsess over my shortcomings. The people at Madison took the time to know who I really was. They had no idea that I had been an anorexic, so that particular stereotype did not color their opinions of me. I was finally recognized for my talents and achievements, not my failures. I was honored as a good student. I was also honored as a cheerleader, and no one cared how I looked in my skirt. I could finally be viewed as a real person. I liked the way that people saw me at Madison, and I was no longer afraid to show my true character and personality. My days as an anorexic taught me many lessons that I would not trade for the world. They taught me about life and how to be a better friend. I learned about the joys of routine tasks such as eating lunch. I learned to appreciate the simple things in life like the gossip shared by a group of teenage girls. I gained an understanding of what true character is. I hold no grudges against those who so desperately tried to help me. In fact, I owe them a great debt. And I appreciate the people who helped me to see that there is more to life than having an eating disorder." 
9, "Save the Elephants  What should be done with a herd of marauding elephants? This was the problem recently confronting officials at Pilanesberg National Park in South Africa. A number of orphaned male elephants had been transported to the park in order to provide them with a safe and nurturing environment. However, this step to protect the elephant population soon threatened another endangered species. The young elephants had entered musth, like puberty, a state of heightened hormonal activity and increased aggression. The elephants went on a killing spree, slaying almost 40 rhinoceros—including incredibly rare black rhinos. The park officials did not want to kill the young elephants, but they could not afford to have any more rhinos slaughtered. Oddly enough, the solution to this disastrous situation was to bring more male elephants into the park. This time, however, they were full-grown bull elephants. In almost no time at all, a previously impossible hierarchy had been established, and the orphaned males fell right into place. No more rhino killings were reported. The Pilanesberg story had a positive ending, but many elephants are not as lucky. The elephant population in Africa has been drastically reduced by loss of habitat to cultivation and urbanization, and many have been orphaned by poachers cashing in on the illegal ivory trade. Some biologists believe that if elephant numbers continue to drop, it will soon be impossible to save the species. Elephants are amazing creatures. As well as holding the title of \"largest land animal,\" they are also among the most intelligent. An elephant has 150,000 muscle units in its trunk, can swim long distances without tiring, walks almost silently despite weighing about 7 tons, can travel up to 6,000 miles in a year while searching for food, and can live 60 years. Full-grown elephants have no natural enemies, other than humans. Like most animals, elephants have an enormous effect on the other animals in their habitat. Eating 165-330 pounds of food a day, an elephant can clear thick brush into open savannah in no time, creating an open habitat for other animals. Several tree species rely almost solely on elephants to scatter their seeds. If the elephant were to disappear, these life-forms would bear the consequences. With only 2 elephant species left out of 600, the danger of extinction is imminent. If the population in any particular area drops below 100 individuals (as it has in several parks), that population is virtually doomed, having entered an \"extinction vortex.\" Continued inbreeding leads to genetic deterioration, which results in fewer reproductive males and females being born. The numbers begin to drop, and the cycle continues until the population completely dies out. Evidence of this genetic deterioration can be seen in elephant tusks, which are gradually becoming smaller. All elephants with exceptionally large tusks have already been poached. Humans have always taken advantage of the incredible strength and endurance of elephants. Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, used elephants to carry his supplies across the Alps in the third century. Elephants have been ridden onto the battlefield, have been trained to carry heavy logs, and were even used during World War II to drag military equipment up steep slopes. We have used elephants to our advantage for more than 2,000 years. Now we are destroying them. Poaching is the chief reason that elephants are brought closer to extinction every day. From 1986 to 1989, 300,000 African elephants were killed for their ivory tusks. In 1986 alone, 75 percent of raw ivory came from illegal poaching—the equivalent of 89,000 elephants. Recently, laws have been instituted that completely ban any hunting of the endangered elephants. However, this has only made poaching easier; without professional hunters carefully patrolling their favorite hunting blocks, park rangers alone are left to deal with poachers. Carrying outdated World War II rifles, the rangers are no match for ruthless poachers with AK-17’s, who have been known to kill rangers, local farmers, and even tourists to avoid capture. The poaching trade began in earnest in 1971, when a severe drought killed 9,000 elephants in a Kenyan game reserve. Neighbors of the park moved in to collect ivory. They found it was very profitable, and when the supply dwindled and they could no longer simply pick it up from the ground, they turned to the living elephants. In 1973 there were 167,000 elephants in Kenya. By 1987, there were only 20,000 left. Raw ivory is shipped by smugglers to factories where it is either carved into sculptures or converted into Chinese medicines (which may actually have very little medicinal value). Criminals in a \"Gang of Eight\" nations conduct this lucrative trade: ivory is smuggled out of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda through middlemen in Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and then smuggled into China and Thailand. The demand for ivory—as well as the price paid to poachers, smugglers, and middlemen—has increased over the years, in some places by 1000 percent. Weapons are also more available due to the civil wars and political unrest in certain African countries. These factors have contributed to increased poaching and will ultimately contribute to the demise of elephants. Many attempts have been made to stamp out poaching in African game reserves, but law enforcement has proved extremely difficult. Lack of funding for conservation projects and for staff to patrol the parks is a major obstacle in the quest to protect threatened species. In addition, many poachers are not the professionals seen on TV, with trucks full of supplies, traps, and technologically advanced weapons. Instead, they come from poor communities adjacent to major parks. The people in these communities have to put up with harassment from wild animals, and they rarely get anything in return. Consequently, they do not object to making some money at the expense of an elephant or two. The scenario is common in the poor countries of Africa, such as Kenya, where 30 million hungry people are crowded into an area the size of Texas. Officials in Zimbabwe and Botswana have tried to remedy this problem in an interesting fashion. They granted ownership of all the wild animals in a certain area to the nearest village or community. Contrary to public expectations, this method was relatively successful. The communities managed resources carefully, monitored their animals well, and even earned money from safari expeditions. Safaris turned out to pay better than trophy hunting. For every trophy hunter who paid a small fortune to shoot a single animal, hundreds of thousands of tourists paid a large fortune to look at the animal. Unfortunately, community ownership of animals seemed to work only in areas with large areas of land and few people. Another approach taken to prevent peasants from turning to poaching was to use money generated by park tourism to build clinics and provide educational programs for surrounding communities. However, because some parks do not attract as many tourists as others do, and also because of the sheer number of poor villages, the benefits were spread too thinly. In recent years, the number of elephant killings due to poaching has decreased, largely due to the worldwide ban (since 1990) on the trade of ivory. However, the illegal trade continues, and as long as it does, poachers will be a part of it. The poaching problem is incredibly intricate. Fueled by the illicit trade to southeast Asia and the rest of the world, it is also the result of a lack of education and public services in African villages. It is evident that a single country cannot successfully combat poaching and the loss of elephant habitat. The world needs to unite like never before if we want to save our remaining elephants."
9, "Student Entrepreneur Reaches for Dreams of the Sky \"You’ve got to know your own value, know what you want, and stick with it.\" That’s what T. McDowell’s advice to others is, and it’s certainly worked for him. This high school senior is currently the sole owner of Immersion Immaging, a successful company specializing in Internet commerce solutions and online financial databasing. McDowell began the company in 2012, although it was originally called 4th Dimension Graphics. Two years later, the company was reorganized as Immersion Immaging. Surprisingly, he didn’t begin the company with the assistance of any partners, but instead founded it on his own with the experience and contacts that he already had. \"It’s always been a one-person operation, and it’s going to stay that way for a while. I could easily take on partners or expand the business some more, but I want to keep it this way for now,\" McDowell said. Even now, McDowell does everything himself, from marketing and management to the actual coding that he writes for his clients’ Web sites. \"I remember one time that I worked for over 800 hours on one site and never really got paid for it. I’ve learned since then,\" McDowell said. Thus far, he has worked for such companies as Online Devices International, Greystone Peripherals, and Publicard, Inc. He works on Web site design along with Internet marketing solutions and other aspects of Internet commerce. \"I don’t have any lack of contracts right now. I like it because it’s flexible, so that if I need more income, I can get the business I need; and if I take a break for a while, I don’t have any problems,\" McDowell said. Spending between 30 and 60 hours a week at his business, Immersion Immaging, provides him with a steady income, although he admits that it takes up much of his free time. \"A lot of the time [on the business] is spent after school and late at night, and my parents don’t really like that too much. Otherwise, though, they’re really supportive of the whole thing,\" McDowell said. Part of the reason McDowell ended up in the computer industry might be explained by the exposure he had as a child. Even as a teenager, most of his friends were older and connected to the computer industry. \"Even though I’m younger than most other people in the technology business, it hasn’t mattered much. A lot of my friends throughout my life have been older than me, so I’m used to it,\" McDowell said. In his freshman year, McDowell worked at a company called PC Powercomp and familiarized himself with the business and the technical aspects of it. Having already started learning various online languages at the beginning of junior high school, McDowell was well prepared to enter this field. \"When I started out with computers, it was mainly because I didn’t have much else to do; so it was a good way to use my time, and it’s turned out to be pretty good,\" McDowell said. However, he spends his free time on more than just computers. His real interest lies in aviation, which he has pursued for more than six years. As a licensed pilot, he currently owns two airplanes and has ambitions to enter the aviation field one day, probably in airplane design. \"Now I work with computers mostly because it gives me a reliable source of income. I’d really rather be in aviation, but I may keep this going so that I’ll always have it to fall back on,\" McDowell said. For now, aviation is still a hobby, but if his entrepreneurial spirit and success with his business are signs of what’s to come, McDowell won’t have a problem realizing his dreams of the sky."
9, "Internet Plagiarism  Not all thieves lurk in dark alleys and parks. Some sit with their faces lit by the glow of their computer monitors, copying, pasting, and printing. It may seem like just another helpful source of information, but the Internet has taken the theft of \"intellectual property\" to a new level. Part of the problem is that most students don’t really know the exact definition of plagiarism or its consequences. Some say that using someone else’s ideas without attributing them is a form of theft, but most people don’t think of it as a serious crime. For teachers, Internet plagiarism has been especially problematic compared to \"theft\" from other sources. This is because it is so difficult to locate the origin of Internet material. To counter student plagiarism, Internet services designed to detect copied material have emerged to aid teachers. One company, TurnItIn.com, has developed a system for detecting material plagiarized from the Internet. Teachers can upload student works onto the site, which searches for similarities to material from all over the Web. The teachers then receive an \"originality report.\" To utilize this technology, teachers have students submit all papers electronically. \"The threat of using [these programs] will stop a lot of students. They will be afraid they’ll be caught. Unfortunately, fear is what works,\" English teacher Judy Grear said. English teacher Barbara Swovelin said, \"With all the info that’s on the Internet, it’s understandable that we go to it to get information. It’s understandable that people would use it as a resource. The legal and moral issues come in when students use it improperly.\" A main concern is not only the use of a few plagiarized sentences, but of entire papers. \"Paper mills\" like SchoolSucks.com and Evil House of Cheat are some of the most popular sources for pirated papers. Sites like these, which have achieved fame and notoriety among slackers everywhere, were the motivation for TurnItIn.com and similar sites. In addition to such blatant \"cut and paste\" plagiarism, most teachers agree that students must be wary of the theft of ideas. One plagiarism-detection program, Word Check, asserts through their Web site, \"Whether you agree or disagree on how information should be used or reused in digital form, one thing is clear: protecting intellectual property from theft and infringement is the number one security issue.\" By some definitions, it seems like everyone plagiarizes. But for many students who feel that they might unknowingly plagiarize, programs like TurnItIn.com are intimidating. The detection system on TurnItIn.com, which is a part of plagiarism.org, claims to detect plagiarism down to the eight-word level, which many fear could include accidental lifting of words. \"You might lift an idea or a line or two. Everybody does that. Some writers don’t read other writers because of it,\" Grear said. Swovelin responds positively to the new technology that detection programs use. \"What we would try to produce would be students who would be ethical. People learn lessons when they do something wrong,\" she said about the program. \"I think that the idea is good,\" Chris M., a senior, said. \"But it might be a little extreme because some phrases are common enough that they might be in more than one essay.\" The thieves are out there, and they aren’t wearing stocking caps. They’re not robbing banks; they’re stealing words."
9, "Mosquito Madness  I’m drifting off to sleep, listening to the summer night’s breeze rustling the leaves on the oak outside my window. Peaceful. Dreamy. Safe. I’m almost asleep when a loud buzzing sound fills my ear. A disturbing annoyance cancels all thoughts of sleep, disturbs all peace. Buzzzzzzzz...buzzzzzzzz...buzzzzzzz. Only a mosquito can make that sound. How did it get in here? Buzzzzz...buzzzzzzz. I swat and slap at this annoying creature. I’ll get it; I know I will. I’ll knock it down in midair and put it out of its misery. That itsy-bitsy pest can’t survive my powerful swipes. So I swing to the left, to the right, above my head, over my stomach, everywhere. I don’t miss an inch of the darkness. Nothing could survive this extreme attack of mine! I probably look like a crazed wind turbine. There, I’m certain now it has to be dead. I had to hit it, with my arms flying everywhere swatting and swiping. It is probably knocked dead, somewhere on the floor . . . I’ll just clean it up in the morning. Slowly my panting ebbs. Tranquility is returning. Then I realize my body is tensing, tensing. It is becoming so tense my muscles start to weaken. It must be tense because I am listening, listening. I’m listening so hard my ears feel like they’re twitching. Silence. Blessed silence. No nasty creature here to bother me anymore. The breeze rustles the leaves; I’m on some beach—azure water, giant white clouds like full-blooming magnolias, warm sand. Suddenly, I snap awake: buzzzzzzz... buzzzzzz... buzzzzzz. No! No! No! Okay, this time I will get it. I swing my feet onto the floor, turn on the light, pick up a T-shirt, and listen. Nothing. I peer everywhere like an eagle. Eagle Eye they should call me—I don’t miss anything. But, I look carefully into the light, and . . . nothing. Do lights attract mosquitoes? I think so. I scan the walls, the ceiling, my T-shirt gripped as hard as possible ready for the assault. Nothing. Silence. I watch the light. I stand still, listening and ready. Nothing. Silence. I wait, stiff as a board. Still nothing. I decide to crawl back into bed, leaving the light on. I cling to the T-shirt. If that tiny pest is still in the vicinity, the light will attract it, and then I shall swat it, and then finally I shall have a peaceful night’s rest. I wait, listen. A car goes by. The breeze rustles the leaves. How can I hear the buzz with all this racket? I get out of bed, close the window, get back into bed, and pick up my deadly weapon. Yes, now I can hear better; I am ready. The breeze won’t disturb me now. I listen. I wait. First, I lie on my back. I can scan the space in my room now. Eagle Eye, that’s me. I tune up both ears to 100 percent capacity. This is good. I was born ready for this adventurous game. I feel my back growing stiff. Suddenly I am not comfortable on my back anymore. I need to turn. I’ll turn toward the light. The light should attract this pestering nuisance. All I really need to do is watch the space around the lamp. I wad up the T-shirt. New strategy. Good strategy. I’m ready and waiting. One swipe and this war will be over. That mosquito will never bother anyone ever again. Then I see it, clinging to the wall like super glue, waiting for me to just smack it. On the count of three, I am going to kill it. One . . . two . . . THREE! SWAT! SWAP! SMACK! SWIPE! Ahhhhhh, at last! Finally, I’ve put that little bug out of its misery—and out of mine. And I guess I’ll just clean it up (along with the broken lamp) in the morning."

But the ship owner got up late in the day and the ship race started early in the day so he got an alarm clock. The next day was the ship race and he got up early. The next day the ship race began and he won the ship race and he won a golden cap and he also became a great fisherman. That night he dreamt that he was the best fisherman in the world. He dreamt he caught a shark and it swallowed him but the next day he caught all the fish he wanted and he lived all his life. The End"

They couldn’t put out the fire because they had no sprinklers. I am mad because fires can kill people. Next time buy some sprinklers. Sincerely, Albert"

My doctor said she had to have 15 kids get a shot. You should drink lots of fluids. So you won’t get sick. If you cannot swllo and your throat is puffy, then you have strep. You should get lots of rest. And get a shot. Because the shot will make you better faster then the medicine.

All schools had cheers. One school’s band was star wars. A dummy was shot out of a cannon. It made me jump!!! We ate snacks at the parade, like sandwiches and juice and carrots. They were good. The parade was two-hours. We sat on a blanket. Things blew every where when [the] float went by whew-clunk. Finally the parade was done. We put the blanket in the trunk. BOOM!!

The Devil Rays hurt us bad. I got disgusted because we lost. The best part was when I got my giraffe beanie baby signed by Alex Roderiguez. The baddest part was when the Devil Rays got ahead. At the beginning my mom blurted out \"Hi Alex\". He grinned, looked up and said \"Hi\". For the rest of the game, my mom kept her eyes on Alex Roderiguez. At the Kingdome, I ate some Twix candy bars. This woman, behind us, named Dana, was crazy about Dan Wilson. She liked him so much she says \"he’s a beautiful thing. DAN WILSON.\" Dana screamed, \"go Danny.\" But she didn’t mean me. "

The Titanic has lied on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean for 86 years. This guy name Robert Ballard found the Titanic. It was pretty close to its destination when it sank. It was sad because only 1,100 people survived. The people who survived got on a ship called the Carpitha. "
2, "Drug Bust By where me and Danielle live, they had a drug bust. Drug Busts are when police come and search drug dealers houses. It is very scary when they have a drug bust because you could get stolen by a drug dealer and never come back. So lock your doors when they have a drug bust around where you live. It was closer to Danielle’s house. It was kind of close to David’s house. It was really close to Kasey Bell’s and Katie Bell’s and Kelsey Bell’s house because they live less than ten yards away. It was boring because you had to stay inside. You couldn’t take one baby step outside. Remember, if there is a drug bust by your house lock your doors! "

At first they were red burning hot. I roasted hot dogs and marshmallows and I like mine burnt because it gives it more taste some time. I like to peel the burnt stuff off of the marshmallows because there is melty stuff in side of it. I make s’mores out of it because it is squishier so it is easier to squish it. It tastes better. When you put water on the fire it goes sizzle sizzle and it sparks. Oh Yeah! Here is some thing really funny. My hair still smells like smoke. I love campfires."

Chapter 2 The Boring airplane On the airplane, I was bored. Then I remembered about my toy that my mom got me. But when I tried it, it was really noisy. That’s why I stopped. Chapter 3 Arriving \"Finally, we’re there\"! I said. Then we got our stuff. Then we walked and walked untill we got to our hotel. Then we got everything organized and then we went to Disney Land. And guess what? I’m not going to tell you what kinds of rides I rode. Ha ha ha. Well all right, I’ll tell you. I went on the Snow Monster, Splash Mountain and different kinds of rides but I can’t remember the names. And I’m so lucky because when I got off Splash Mountain they let me go on it again. And we did the same stuff the next day, and then the next. But the last day we went in the haunted house. Inside it the pictures turned into nice ones and scary ones. Then there is a ride in it and when you go on it there is a mirror and one person turns into a skeleton in it and I turned in to the skeleton in the mirror. The we got out and went to our hotel room and packed our stuff and went on the airplane again. This was really exciting to me. In fact, it was the best days of my life. And I’ll always remember it. The End."   
3, "How My Situation Turned Out I got this assignment to do. I had to write about an event that I regretted. But I didn’t do it. I didn’t tell my parents about it. Meanwhile, Ms. Stromberg asked me every day about this assignment. I didn’t do this assignment because I couldn’t think of anything to write about. I didn’t ask my mom for help, because I thought she would get mad at me. When Ms. Stromberg asked me about my work, I just rolled my eyes. I hoped it would go away. However, what did happen, was Ms. Stromberg sent home a note which I didn’t give to my parents. Finally, Ms. Stromberg talked to my mom about it. When my mom heard about this, she got mad and hurt. She was mad because I didn’t do my work, and hurt because I thought she would get mad at me if I asked for help. I had to do this work until my parents were satisfied. I didn’t get any books all weekend and no TV all Friday. I got very mad. I got so mad, I didn’t think I’d ever read again. I feel totally dumb. I should have gone to my parents for help. It was all my fault. I learned that I shouldn’t lie because it gets me into worse trouble. In the future I’m not going to lie. If I have a problem, I’m going to tell someone about it, and ask for help."
3, "Ashes All Over Ashes All Over The day after Thanksgiving my family had a reunion for my grandmother on a boat because she died of cancer about a month ago. We were all sitting in a circle, reading letters about her and saying memories. Then from oldest to youngest, we went outside, and threw a rose and a cup of grandmother’s ashes out into the water. I asked if I could go alone so I could have a special time with grandmother. When it was my turn I went outside, said a few words and threw the rose. Then I picked up the cup and filled it with ashes. But I threw the ashes a little crooked and they fell on the bumpers, and because the wind was very hard the ashes blew back all over me and the boat. Everyone inside was laughing really hard, I was even laughing myself! I thought it was because of what happened. But then my mom told me that she did the same thing to my grandfather 4 years ago. She said that she had twisted her hand a little, and it all flew back all over her and my aunt Shelly. That made me laugh even harder, and my mom said that grandma Jin always liked a good laugh! I think everyone got a good laugh. A little bit later I got to have the extra roses to throw outside and say what I wanted to say. I had a wonderful time that day."
3, "Surprise Snowstorm It was a snowy day in January. It was a Surprise Snowstorm with about 6 inches of snow. Grandma and grandpa came over from Ellensburg. Mom and grandma went to a baby shower and my sister Julia had our friend Lil over. Our grandpa wanted to see my dad’s jobsite and we had to go over Whitney Bridge hill to get there. The roads were very icey so when we got to the top of the hill, I felt a big lurch and dad yelled \"hold on\"! But it was to late. We slid into the ditch. Two other cars slid to the side of the road. Grandpa’s truck did too, a few yards ahead of us. Dad got out of our truck to go help put chains on grandpa’s tires. But when he got in, the chains fell off and the truck skreeched and slid to the bottom of the hill. Dad’s trucks tire had popped off, so dad, Dyllan (my other sister) Lil, Julia and I jumped down from it toward grandpa at the bottom of the hill. I sat in the sled with Dyllan to calm her, dad pulled us and Julia and Lil carried grandpa’s chains. We started down the hill and a big truck passed by. When we started walking again, I slid on my knees in between some abandoned cars by the road. I felt the cars moving and one hit my head. I could not do anything but crawl through the tires to the ditch on the other side. Quickly, a man pulled me out. I learned that the big truck had bumped into the cars causing them to move. Everyone was okay. Julia and Lil had been in front of the cars. Grandpa gave anyone who wanted one a ride and dropped them off where they wanted to go. Then we went home. That is a story I will never forget! "
3, "Recorders Screech, screech, screech! The first time we tried to play the recorders it sounded like a lion running his claws down a chalkboard. In other words we made a TERRIBLE noise! See, a recorder is an instrument with a very high pitch. If you don’t blow in it correctly, it does sound pretty bad. After Mrs. Romland told us there is a special place for our tongue to be, we understood why we sounded so bad. She said the place was right behind your upper front teeth, and then she said once your tongue is there, put the recorder up to your mouth and try to say \"too, too, too, too\". It’s called tonguing. Then we almost got the right sound. A recorder looks like a short skinny tube with one hole on the bottom, and 7 holes on the top. There are a few different types of recorders. The one we are playing is called the soprano, it is the smallest with the highest sound. Another is the alto, it is bigger with a lower sound. Next comes the tenor, it is bigger yet, with an even lower sound. Last but not least is the bass, it is the biggest of them all and the lowest sounding too. The recorder originally came from Europe. It has been an instrument for over 100 years. If you think it is related to the flute, it’s not."  
3, " \"Ramona Quimby, Age 8\" by Beverly Cleary  Touch of the flu! Egg in her hair? Poor Ramona! \"Ramona Quimby, Age 8\" is a nine chapter, one hundred and ninety page book about an eight year old girl in third grade. She started school with a surprise gift from her dad, only to have it stolen by a boy she called \"Yard Ape\". One day at lunch she tried to be cool and show off for her friends by cracking an egg on her head and found herself in a big mess. When flu season hit she learned how awful it felt to throw up in class. She and her sister learn about using good manners at the dinner table. As time goes on Ramona and her family solve their problems, and learn to be more caring for each other. They also learn to be more considerate for each other when time alone is needed. My favorite part was during a scene where Ramona’s class is at lunch, \"She took a firm hold on her egg, waited until everyone at her table was watching, and whack—she found herself with a hand full of crumbled shell and something cool and slimy running down her face.\" (\"Ramona Quimby, Age 8\", Bevery Cleary, p. 60) I thought that was funny because she wanted to be cool like the rest of her class, by breaking a hard boiled egg on her head. But guess what, her mother was in such a hurry she gave Ramona a raw egg! Whoops! I think the one thing the author wants me to know is that when my family may be having problems I can be of help by obeying them and not fussing, disturbing, and/or annoying them. I liked this book because the author chose strong, powerful, descriptive words that made gross, imaginative pictures in my mind. Like in her lunch scene at school, \"something cool and slimy running down her face\", and at her dinner scene at home, \"One edge of her meat was covered with tiny bumps.\" \"Ramona Quimby, Age 8\" is one of the best Beverly Cleary books I’ve ever read because it pulled me in better than any other book in her series. (I have read 6 of her books.) It made pictures in my mind (Word Choice) and sounded like a real person wrote it (Voice). It also sounded good as I read it, flowed easily from sentence to sentence (Sentence Fluency), and sounded like a real 8 year old girl’s life. These traits made me want to keep on reading until the end of the book. I recommend this book to good readers who enjoy good long lasting chapters*. *Max. 25 pages."
3, "Chores! Chores! Chores! Chores are boring! Scrubbing toilets, cleaning sinks, and washing bathtubs take up a lot of my time and are not fun at all. Toilets! When you’re scrubbing toilets make sure they are not stinky. I’ve scrubbed one before and I was lucky it didn’t stink. I think toilets are one of the hardest things to scrub in the bathroom because it is hard to get up around the rim. Sinks are one of the easiest things to clean in the bathroom because they have no rims and they are small. I have cleaned one before and it was pretty easy. Bathtubs, ever washed one? They are big, they are deep, and it is hard to get up around the sides. The bathtub is the hardest, I think, to wash in the bathroom. All chores are boring, especially making my bed. Cleaning my room is OK because I have to organize, and I like organizing. Dusting is the worst: dust, set down, pick up, dust, set down. There are so many things to dust, and it’s no fun. Chores aren’t the worst but they’re definitely not the best! "
3, "Attack of My Older Brother  I just hate it. I mean really, really, really positively hate, being taken by surprise. Just thinking about it makes me shiver. Boy, I’ve been taken by surprise lots of times, lots of ways, by many different people. In my opinion, I think the worst surprise I have been through must have been when I got home from school and expected to see my older brother waiting for me or watching television. But no, my brother wasn’t home (at least it seemed like it to me) so, I yelled for my dad outside. No dad. Poor me scared without a brother or father (yeah right) and right when I was walking to my brother’s room, boom! Ahhhh! I screamed, my brother jumps out of the closet in the hall. I was really frightened. I’ll never forget that, it will scar me for life. After that I figured out my dad was outside somewhere where he could not hear me. I have also been taken by surprise many other times but none of them as worse as \"The attack of my older brother.\" It is so annoying when they do it more than once. Example: Laura jumps out of the kitchen and scares Trish and then she leaves. Seconds later Trish passes by the kitchen again, Laura screams \"Raahh,\" Trish doesn’t scream but is now annoyed. Getting taken by surprise happens most unexpected. I think I will get scared more if you don’t make it so fancy, make it original. Example for original: She jumps out screaming \"Raahh,\" is original. Example for fancy: He jumps out screaming, \"Ooga, Booga,\" along with streamers, confetti etc. That is way too fancy. Me, Trisha Arnold, will give you some advice that I learned: don’t take it seriously. It might be scary but, go be free, live along with your life, that’s the best cure. Even for \"The attack of my older brother.\"   "
3, "How to Eat Fried Worms Eyuuuuuuuuu! Nasty! This book was very gross at the beginning because the bullies made a bet with Tom. The bet was for Tom to eat fifteen worms for 50 dollars. What brought me in to the story was the lead which was \"Hey Tom where were you last night?\" As I got further into the story it kind of made me want to try a worm ‘cause in the fifth and sixth chapter it says, \"The worms were okay\". During the eighth and ninth chapter Tom got a very bad stomach ache from all those worms. Tom didn’t only lose 50 dollars he lost energy from those worms because when he got the stomach ache he couldn’t do anything. How he lost is he missed his worm. When Tom’s mom learned about the bet she punished him by sending him to his room till dinner. The author included lots of detail. It made really wonderful pictures in my mind from the long and descriptive words that the author used. I think the author wrote this book to tell us not to bet. It is a bad thing to bet because it can hurt your body. I recommend this book for readers who like adventures and interesting stories. "
3, "Teeth Don’t Make Good Brakes Flying through the air on my bike was a very frightening moment. It was a Wednesday and my family was celebrating my dads birthday. My friend, my cousin Laura, and I decided to go bike riding. I started going faster and faster not knowing what was going to happen. And I flew off my bike. What made me fall off? Maybe my bike tire hit a rock!! Then I noticed I chipped three teeth. Ahhhh!!!! As we were walking back I was bleeding a lot and aching all over. Finally we got home. I got ice on my lip which was swollen. My cousin Jessica called the dentist and we went there right away. Nobody was at the dentists office except for me. He numbed my lip so I could have a good night sleep. After we were done at the dentist we went to the store to get straws for me to sip juice. My dad and I stayed in the car while my mom and my brother went inside. After we went to the store we went home and I went to sleep. The next two days I didn’t go to school. From now on I will be more cautious when I ride my bike."

Only two blocks along the unfamiliar street, John came to a small corner candy store.\" (The Chocolate Touch, by Patrick Skene Catling, page 11-12) And that’s where his chocolate touch began. Whatever he put into his mouth it turned to chocolate. And the king? \"Well one day Midas was sitting in his treasure room dreaming about his gold. In his dream he saw a shadow fall across the piles of valuable gold coins, he looked up and saw a stranger standing near him.\" (King Midas and the Golden Touch, by Judy Rosenbaum, page 2) And that’s where his golden touch began. Whatever he touched with his hands, it turned to gold. They liked their touch… for a while. Then one day a terrible thing happened! Now you read the rest of the book to find out what the terrible thing was. And when you are done reading this book, you will find out it teaches you a lesson about greediness. By the way, there are some parts you should know about. Like the time John turned his trumpet to chocolate, and the time King Midas turned his food to gold. Both of these books pulled me in with a good lead! The Chocolate Touch started with \"Most of the time John Midas was a very nice boy. Every now and then, of course, he broke a rule.\" King Midas and the Golden Touch started out with \"Once upon a time there was a very rich King named Midas. He lived in a fine castle with his daughter Marygold.\" I wanted to read the whole book in one day because it got really exciting and interesting with the fun and powerful words the author used. The Chocolate Touch had a little more detail and action than The Golden Touch because the book was longer by 80 pages. " 
4, "Middle of the Night Surprise I woke up swiftly. My senses were blurred, except for my hearing. All I could hear was the sound of footsteps stepping on the creaky board in the hallway. I waited for the footsteps to go into the living room. I walked as lightly as I possibly could but no matter how hard I tried, I still made noise. I slipped past my parents room and entered the living room very cautious. I searched the room and found nothing. I went into the kitchen to find three small wrapped presents on the table. I sleekly ran back into my brothers’ room. I brought them into the kitchen. We opened the present and found three sheets of paper. One piece had little lines with symbols under them. The other two made up the key. I pieced together: on January 8th we are going to. The last I spelled out loud. \"D\" \"I\" \"S\" \"N\" \"E\" \"Y\" \"L\" \"A\" \"N\" \"D\"!! I got up to see my mom. I jumped for joy and was thrilled out of my mind."
4, "When I Grow Up …I tried to run, but I couldn’t. The monster seemed like it was growing by the minute! And then, the most horrible thing was about to happen… I screamed and sat bolt upright up in bed. I gasped swallowing huge amounts of air. I’d just had the most horrible nightmare ever. I’d never been so scared in my life! Still gasping, I called \"Mom!\" My mom came sleepily into my bedroom and sat on the edge of my bed. \"What is it sweetie?\" she asked, her voice full of concern. Tears swelled up in my eyes as I remembered the ghostly monster from my dream. \"I… I had a nightmare.\" I finally managed to say. \"Poor thing,\" my Mom said sympathetically as she gave me a hug. \"But don’t worry,\" she said, \"you will stop having them when you grow up.\" I nodded my head in agreement. Although inside I secretly felt that I wouldn’t. After my Mom left, I lay on my pillows and started to think. People—mostly grownups—were always telling me that things would happen, or I would like something better when I was \"grown up.\" Apparently they thought being grown up meant liking everything and knowing everything. Well I most certainly did not! Personally I thought growing up meant having responsibility, and trying to make good choices, etc. I wondered if my life would be different as a grown-up. I mean I knew I would be older, and more mature, but would I be prettier? fatter? skinnier? would I choose to get married? or get a job? Then I realized something. I was nine years of age. Right now none of that stuff mattered. I didn’t need a husband because I had older siblings! I didn’t need a job because my Mom and dad provided for me. The only job I had right now was to be a kid. And that was just what I was going to do." 
4, "Day of Destiny It was a humid day in July, the Key Bank sign said that it was 85 degrees outside. That day my mom drove me to The Smithfield Theater. I had an important job to do. The job was more of a personal goal. It was to make people laugh. The catch was that if I was to stand up in front of a theater of people and tell a couple of jokes then I would get to see the movie \"Mission Impossible\" free. When I got to the theater I was sweating like a pig. The librarian that signed me up was dressed in a clown suit. She said, \"Are we ready to make people laugh?\" I feebly answered, \"Yes...\" When I got inside the theater a guy was already telling some lame jokes. Then, when everyone was seated he called my name, \"C’mon down Zachary Williams!\" As I reached the first step to the stage I had about a hundred butterflies in my stomach. By the third step they multiplied. But then, very abruptly, when I reached for the microphone all of the butterflies disappeared. When I was done telling the jokes I didn’t turn red or anything, I just smiled. I noticed the size of the crowd and unexpectedly I knew what I was going to be when I grew up, I knew why God had put me on this green earth, it was because I was going to become… a comedian."
4, "January 20, 1993 Dear Mr. President, Today was probably one of the most important days of your life. The speech you gave was very, very hopeful, sincere, and thoughtful. There are two main issues that I think you should focus on. First, I would like you to work on getting more money to go into schools. I would like to see every school in Washington, and every other state, with enough learning space, tools, and good teachers. I would also like to see the government working for the people instead of the people being servants of the government. The people should not be out there, working their heads off, just so that they can give the government the little amount of hard-earned money they have. The government should be by the people and for the people, instead of by the people and for the politicians. You must have a very hard job and I know you won’t be able to do everything by yourself. I hope that you will have plenty of support. I know that you will do your best to do well as President, be able to make good judgements, and make our country into the country that it was meant to be by our founders. My best wishes to you and your extra-hard job. Sincerely, Mindy Franklin  " 
4, "The Beach House I will always love my grandparent’s beach house. The way the waves role over the gooey sand, and the way the sand weaves in between your toes. The way we pick up barnacle-covered rocks and watch the sand crabs scurry away, and how we dig for clams and end up knee deep in the never ending sand. I’m not the only one to share these pleasures. My aunt, uncle, cousins, family, and of course, my grandparents also share this. In the summer we play volleyball, baseball, and badminton. At my grandparent’s 4th of July party we go out on the boat called Sea Biscuit. At night we snuggle up in our blankets and toast marshmallows in the campfire while we watch the fireworks explode in the star-filled sky. We have bullhead fishing contests to see who can catch the most bullhead. Then we throw the bullheads back into the salty blue-green ocean. With one final splash they say goodbye to the unfamiliar world. Then they disappear to somewhere known to only the fish and the crabs. We go to a sand bar a couple houses down where we collect sea shells and sand dollars. We fly over the bar, our feet touching every grain of sand, leaving a sign that we were there. Gathering shells and dollars in our pockets, we head back to the place we love with all our hearts. When it’s time to go, none of us want to leave. As I say my goodbyes, I think of all the fun we had, and what fun we will have next time. "
4, "Kids Need Their Recess! \"Michael, please tell me…\" This is a child’s average day in the classroom. The teacher asks a question, the child answers. But children, as we all know, seemingly cannot sit still for long periods of time, and as the average school day lasts for about six hours, they need a break. This is only one of the many reasons that recess was created. Why now take away possibly one of the greatest inventions (besides the wheel) ever to come about? Recess was meant to take the energy out of kids so they’d come back to the classroom ready to learn. If we take away even one recess, children may be too energetic and hyper to even pay attention to the lesson. The \"art\" of passing notes will most likely increase and kids may learn even less without recess! It’s not just a matter of education, lots of parents agree that children should enjoy their youth while they still can, and live a \"worry free\" life before they must face the \"real world.\" After all, you have to admit, being cramped up in a desk all day is rather uncomfortable, not to mention boring. So, not only do kids need recess to learn, they need it to maintain their youth. As you’ve probably heard on the news, lots of kids are complaining about too much homework lately. This is the main reason that some people want to take away recess, to cover the homework during this time. But most schools have a 15 min. recess in the morning and a 30 min. recess in the afternoon. How much more learning can you pack into 45 or 30 min. anyway? Recess isn’t enough time for any heavy duty learning, it’s just enough for kids to get their energy out. So, I come to my conclusion: Kids need their recess!  " 
5, "Bad Bad Mud I come to you today with some good advice: DON’T WALK IN MUD!!! It all started when Melissa and me were walking outside, with umbrellas in hands, rain boots, rain jackets, and no fear from the rain. We were set for anything. At least that’s what we thought. But the real truth lay before us! Melissa asked, \"Can we go into the cow pasture?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"Ok, let’s go on the count of three,\" said Melissa. We both said together, \"One, Two, Three.\" We both took off like we were being chased by a ghost! We had run to the edge of the barn and came to a halt. There before us was a pasture full of mud! Melissa said, \"What are you stopping for?\" I said, \"MUD!\" She said, \"Look just follow me. You won’t get stuck, I promise!\" Before I could say Yes or No, she was off! My heart was pounding. A little voice in my head kept saying, \"Don’t do it,\" \"Don’t do it,\" over and over again. Melissa was going deeper and deeper into the cow pasture. She wasn’t sinking so why would I? It’s just a bunch of dirt, I said to myself. So I took one step, then another and there I was in the middle of the pasture. Actually standing there in mud! \"Melissa,\" I said. \"This isn’t so bad.\" Wait, what am I felling? Thick, cold, gooey, watery, mud! I was sinking as fast as a light bulb burns out. I felt like someone was pushing and pulling me under. My fear was coming true! I started yelling for help. Melissa heard me and came running over to see what my problem was. I told Melissa, \"The ground is sucking me under!\" \"Quick pull me out!\" She tugged and tugged at my boots, but the mud was winning. We both started screaming for help! To the rescue came my sister Jennie and my cousin Natasha. They grabbed a hold of me and all pulled. Out I popped, but my boots remained. I stepped on my umbrella and then pulled my boots out. My feet were now black and freezing. I put my boots back on and made a mad dash, barely touching the ground, and I was out of the gate! To Melissa I said, \"Score one for mud and I’m out!\" "
5, "The Crash It all started on a hot sunny day. I didn’t think anything was going to happen, but boy was I wrong! \"Want to go for a bike ride?\" my friend Lisa asked me. We had just gotten to a really cool camp ground. It had a swimming pool, but the part that I liked the most was the cabins. They were surrounded by tall trees. There was a little trail that I thought would be a perfect place to run away to and have a romantic night with a boy, but enough of that mushy gushy stuff. \"Sure!\" I responded as I was already getting my bike and helmet. We wobbled onto the road. We peddled as fast as we could so when we went over pot holes or the turtles, we would bounce off our seat like a bouncey ball. Around the corner, over the bump! Ok here comes the turn. At first it looks like a nice turn, an ordinary turn, but that is exactly what it wants you to think. Here we go! I felt like I was going 100 m.p.h. CRASH! BOOM! BANG! My so called legs or what was left of them were squashed between two unmoving cars. The bony stems that were dangling from the rest of my body were unmovable. \"OWWWWWW!\" I screeched, but what I did not know was that five angry people were staring at me. \"What happened here?\" probably one of the biggest guys in history said. \"I’m sooo sorry about the car!\" \"Well it’s not my car, and I’m glad!\" The car on the left had a black streak from side to side from my handle bar. The big hairy son of a God (I call him that because he was so big) walked me back to my camp site. Later that evening… \"Sarah you have to come. YOU crashed into the cars so you WILL come.\" The horrible words came from my own dad’s mouth. \"No! No! No! This isn’t happening.\" I imagined a guy about two times bigger than the first, but to my surprise the humungous person I had imagined was a skinny stick! The skinny stick said that no harm was done. All it needed was a coat of paint. So I guess that I lived happily ever after except that I couldn’t walk for the rest of the trip. Maybe that camp ground wasn’t so cool after all.   "
5, "It Goes Louder and Louder  \"What?! What?! I can’t hear you.\" My music was blaring too loudly. \"Let me turn it down!\" \"Joe, this is the second time I’ve told you to turn your music down!\" That’s my mom. She is ALWAYS nagging me to turn my music down. I somehow have to convince her my loud music should be able to be as loud as I like it. At first I was very weak. Every time I blasted my music, she would come in and tell me to turn it down. I would sadly mope over to the stereo and turn it down, and then apologize. That was when I realized I had to take action or risk some kind of lifetime psychological complex for not being able to stand up to people. \"Joe! Joe! Turn that music down!\" I could barely make out those words, but when my mom busted into my room I knew there was going to be trouble. \"Why don’t you ever turn your music down?\" she yelled. \"It seems like you are becoming deaf. The less you can hear it, the more you turn it up. Is that right?\" \"No, it’s just that I like the music to be exploding with noise. You can’t tell me when you were a kid, you didn’t practically blow your speakers out listening to the Beatles or whatever you listened to.\" \"You’re right, I can’t,\" she admitted. I had her now, I thought. \"But still, that doesn’t mean you have to blast yours.\" \"Well, what do you expect me to listen to? Beethoven?\" \"Well… Would that be so bad?\" \"Yes! Of course it would. How about I can blast my music while I do my chores? Then you could go outside or something.\" \"Well, okay, but if it doesn’t work out, you will pay the price in a way that you can’t imagine.\" From that point on my life has been good. Except for the chores. I think my mom got the better end of the deal on that one."   
5, "Tuna Can of Death Chapter 1 – The attempt on my life I walked into the kitchen and asked \"What are we having for dinner?\" \"Tuna Casserole,\" she replied. \"Mom, you know I hate tuna,\" I said unhappily. \"Come on John, give it another try. You haven’t had any tuna fish since last year.\" \"OK, I’ll give it a little try,\" I whined. I went and sat down at the dining room table. I picked up my fork and tried to scoop up some tuna. The minute my fork touched the disgusting food, I knew something was wrong. \"Mom, this stuff’s stale!\" I shouted at her. \"Let me see the date on the can.\" My mom brought out the can the tuna came out of. I silently read the date. \"Eeeewww!\" I cried out. \"The date says 2/1/96!\" \"Whoops,\" said my mom. \"I thought it said ’97. I’m sorry,\" she said apologetically. \"This stuff could have killed me.\" Chapter 2 – The tuna can lives That night, I woke up hearing voices. \"Rats, he noticed my date. Couldn’t you have ‘accidentally’ cut off my date?\" a voice said angrily. \"If I did that the mother would have thrown me away,\" another voice replied. I can’t believe it! I thought to myself. The tuna can lives, and the can opener is in it with him! The tuna can spoke again. \"Let’s get him now! We’ll sneak into his room and you can cut him with your blade!\" \"OK!\" the opener replied. I snuck out my window and went into my garage. I grabbed the sledge hammer and went back into the house. When the tuna can and the can opener opened my door, I ran towards them waving the sledge hammer and screaming \"Yaa, death to tuna!!!\" My mom came running into the room to find me smashing the can opener and a tuna can to itty bitty smidgens. \"What are you doing?!\" she yelled. \"You’re grounded!\" Epilogue I didn’t care about getting grounded. What I did care about is destroying tuna. Today I am still against tuna and probably will be for a long time to come.   "
5, "There’s No Place Like Home On a dark December night in 1776, as he led a barefoot brigade of ragged revolutionaries across the icy Delaware River, George Washington said, \"Shift your fat behind, Harry. But slowly or you’ll swamp the darn boat.\" He was talking to General Henry Knox (they called him \"Ox\" for short). There’s a painting of George Washington where he’s standing up in a boat scanning the riverbank for Redcoats. I always thought he just wanted a good view. But I guess the reason he was standing was because he didn’t have a place to sit down. Finding a seat in his own boat was hardly the worst of General Washington’s problems. It was cold and wet and icy, and his men were tired and didn’t have warm clothes to wear or even enough food to eat. The Revolutionary War was hard on everyone, but it was hard on Washington most of all because he wanted to be home with his wife and children. From 1759, until he was called to fight in 1775, Washington lived with his wife, Martha, and her two children. Washington loved his big farm in Mt. Vernon, Virginia, and although he was one of our country’s most brilliant generals, he was really just a farmer at heart. In a letter he wrote to a friend in England, he said, \"I can nowhere find such great satisfaction as in working on my plantation.\" He didn’t even want to be President. He said he would feel like a criminal going to his death if he took office. But after everyone voted for him, he felt it was his duty to accept. Washington was our President for the next eight years, but during that time he just wanted to get back home. He would spend weekends there whenever he could, and he made sure he got reports on the condition of his farm. He also liked getting letters from his family. Then, in March of 1797, Washington finally got to go home for good. There were no more wars to fight, and John Adams was going to be President. Washington had been a good President, but he was tired of it. Even his granddaughter noticed how happy he was to be home. In a letter to a friend she wrote, \"Grandpa is much pleased with being once more Farmer Washington.\" I always used to think of George Washington as a soldier and a politician, and I guess I always will. But he was really just a farmer. He reminds me a little of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. All she wanted to do was get back home. And finally the Wizard told her she could just click her red shoes three times and say \"There’s no place like home.\" But George Washington and his men didn’t have shoes when they went across the Delaware River. Maybe if they did, history would have turned out completely different."   
5, "The Tragic Asparagus Story Chapter One The very first time I saw asparagus I hated it. I had never even tried it before, and I still hated it! I tried to pretend like it was not even there and just eat the rest of the meal, but when I was about to get up my dad looked over at my plate and immediately said, \"No, you may not go ‘till you have eaten all of that asparagus.\" I knew right then and there that there was no way out of it. I lifted a minuscule bite to my mouth and tasted it. YUCK!!! Gross! I made a hysterical face and pushed my plate towards the center of the table. There, after a couple of minutes of thinking, an idea suddenly came to me. Slowly, I scraped some of the food into my napkin and put it in my cat’s food dish. She ate the asparagus and after about half an hour threw up. My mom and dad knew it had been from the asparagus. I got sent to my room. I knew they thought that they were teaching me a lesson, but they weren’t. I could still hate the look, smell, and taste of asparagus. Chapter Two I must have fallen asleep last night without knowing it because when I woke up it was morning. That is, another boring, rainy, Saturday morning. I could smell the leftovers of breakfast from the kitchen, so I got up and slipped into my robe and slippers and started running up the stairs. Halfway up, I suddenly stopped. What if mom and dad were still mad at me for feeding the cat asparagus? As soon as the word \"asparagus\" came into my head a horrible taste filled my mouth. Again I was tasting that gross disgusting taste. I ran up the rest of the way and went into the kitchen and went to the fridge to find something to drink. After drinking half a quart of eggnog I felt much better. I went into my brother’s room where he was playing with a football. He looked up when I came in the room. \"Hi,\" he said, \"wanna score some touchdowns?\" \"Uh, no, I’ve got better things to do with my time.\" Then I asked him, \"Where’s mom?\" \"How should I know?\" was his response. I took about fifteen minutes to look for mom and didn’t find her. So I got washed and dressed and ate a P.B.J. Then I sat down wondering what on earth to do. A few seconds later my mom came into the room and sat down on the sofa with me and said, \"Honey, I know you didn’t mean to make the cat sick but you should have used your brain!\" \"I know, I know,\" I complained. We had a long conversation. Then after a few minutes mom got up and said, \"Oh by the way, we’re having asparagus for lunch!\" NO!!!  Chapter Three \"Alex! Lunch is ready!\" my sister called from the top of the stairs. \"Coming!\" I called. Although I wasn’t coming. I needed time to think. If they were serving asparagus for lunch they could forget it! I was not eating asparagus again, and that was final! * * * I was sitting at the table with a cold plate of icky asparagus in front of me. It tasted like moldy brains. Everyone else had excused them self ages ago leaving me all alone to finish my disgusting lunch and mourn. I wondered if anyone felt sorry for me. I checked my watch, 1:30! I’d been at the table for an hour and twenty minutes! I decided there was nothing else left to do but finish up the asparagus. So I got a glass of juice from the fridge and started eating, taking each bite with a gulp of juice afterwards. Finally I was done! I jumped up and started down the stairs to my room. I sat down at my desk and took out a piece of clean stationary and began writing. I was writing to QFC because I knew they had asparagus, I had been shopping there several times. This is what my letter said: Dear Mr. Store Manager, I would like you to throw away all your asparagus. It is causing tragic hazards in my house. If you would like to contact me my address is 1823 Allen Ave. Your asparagus hater, Alex Carter After I was through I folded up the letter, dropped it in an envelope, and put on a stamp. I wanted just to leave it on my desk and give it to the mailman when he delivers, but I just knew that one of my pesky siblings would get into it. So I slipped on a sweatshirt and walked down to the corner mail box and mailed my letter myself. Chapter Four \"Alex! Alex! ALLEEEXXXX!!!\" Hmmm? I had been stuck in a great book and hadn’t the slightest clue what was going on around me. I put a marker in my book and ran outside where my sister had been calling me. \"What’s the big idea? Are you trying to make me deaf?\" I asked with a slight scowl. \"No, I just wanted you to know mom is going shopping.\" \"Oh, is that all?\" I said with another frown. Hmmph! I stalked back to my book. The book I was reading was called Aliens Invade Vegetable Gardens. Perfect for my problem. I planned to find a solution to the asparagus situation and then naturally I would fix it! Fifteen minutes later I put away my book and went to dinner. As soon as I walked in the dining room I smelled trouble. I looked down at my plate and saw what I smelled! Brussels sprouts! I gave a loud tragic moan and knew this was going to be another story written by Alex Carter. But for now, I would feed my brussels sprouts to the fish."   
5, "I Wonder What Ken Thinks of This? Dolls of Doom I hate Barbie dolls. The worst things are the commercials. They have annoying little songs that they run in the background while these girls are going \"Wow! Her braid changes color!\" and giggling their heads off. I had the little jingle for that dumb \"Pet Doctor Barbie\" running in my head for two weeks straight. Why did the song stop then? They came out with a new one! My sister has this weird one where the legs change from that weird orangey-pink skin color to some sort of sparkly black when you put the doll in cold water. \"When the water’s cold, Barbie dives right in; her wet suit magically appears on her skin!\" Wet suit, shmet suit. I tried spraying the legs of the doll with some cold water, and it looked like either a whole bunch of moles or some weird case of skin cancer. More and more keep coming out, more \"Dolls of Doom\", as I call them. Sure, they’re selling by the thousands. But they only keep them interested for a month, and then they ask for another, and the cycle goes on. Pretty soon, some little girl’s room will be filled with Barbies. If that happens to my little sister, her room will cave in on mine, which is right under it, unfortunately. When I’m old enough, I’ll join the Army and get myself an M-1 tank or a fleet of Harriers or something, and raid Mattel. Or maybe I’ll make them make a doll like \"Militia Barbie\" or \"In the Navy Now Barbie.\" Pretty soon, all the little girls in America will be saying: \"I wanna Barbie, not a GI Joe!\" Down with the dolls! Nuke every Fred Meyers or Toys ‘R’ Us that carries them! Let the revolution for a Barbie-free America begin!"  
5, "Cokie & the Special Place \"We’re moving.\" That’s what she told him. He couldn’t believe it! He had just made the basketball team and was making more friends. \"What!\" He exclaimed. \"I’m sorry Jessie, but your Dad got a new job in Oregon.\" \"I wish you would stop dragging me around like a doll!\" he yelled. He ran upstairs and slammed his door. His basketball poster fell down and he kicked it into his closet. He flopped down onto his bed and soon fell asleep. * * * KNOCK, KNOCK! \"Who is it?\" Asked Jessie. \"It’s me,\" said his Mom. \"Go away,\" Jessie grumbled. \"I didn’t decide to move to Oregon, your Dad’s having a hard time,\" said his Mom. There was a long silence. \"Good night, Jessie.\" * * * The sun gleamed through the window shining on Jessie. He went downstairs and poured some cereal into a bowl. He stared at his cereal and let it go soggy. He went back into his room and started to pack up his toys and clothes. His family was poor and he was used to moving. Later, the moving men came in and loaded his furniture into the moving truck. Jessie climbed into his family’s tiny white Toyota and slumped onto the back seat. He stared out of his window and silently said goodbye to his old house. He fell asleep holding onto his basketball. Jessie woke up to see the white Toyota turn into a gravel road. After a minute the moving truck turned onto a driveway and a grey and blue two story house stood in front of him. He slowly got out of the car and went inside the new house. He found his room on the second floor and started to unpack his stuff. Later he decided to go look around. He packed a sandwich and went outside. Up the road was some woods. He followed a faint path into the woods where he saw an old shack. Jessie opened the door and something jumped at him. \"AHHHHHH!\" yelled Jessie. He tripped on a stone and fell onto his back. He opened up his eyes to see a cat standing on his stomach. It was tan colored with a stripe of white on its forehead. An old collar that said \"COKIE\" was strapped onto the cat’s neck. Cokie got up and ran back into the old shack. Jessie followed Cokie into a room. He leaned against the wall and sighed. All of a sudden the wall made a grinding sound and a whole book stand appeared where a moldy wall had been. He ran to the books and started to read a book called ‘THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR\". A tiny switch was half into the wall. He pushed it and the books disappeared and the moldy wall was back again. He raced back to his house and was half way up the stairs when his Mom asked, \"Where have you been?\" \"Oh, just exploring the woods,\" Jessie said grinning. * * * He visited the shack many times to read the books. But one day when he was reading a book called \"ONCE WHEN I LIVED IN SPACE\" someone said, \"So you found it.\" Jessie whirled around to see his Mother walking into the old room. \"How did you know I was here?\" demanded Jessie. \"Before you were born, my grandparents used to come here. They lived up the road. When they were kids they made this place. Grampa was an electricity nerd and he must have built this,\" she said, marveling at the bookshelf. A single tear slid down her cheek. \"Then they forgot about it.\" \"The library in town is running out of books. We can sell about half of these to the librarian and she’ll give us enough money to pay the rent and help us buy some new things,\" said Jessie’s Mom. \"Can I keep Cokie?\" asked Jessie. \"Sure,\" said his Mom. \"I guess moving isn’t so bad\" said his Mom. \"I guess not,\" said Jessie grinning. "
6, "A Bitter Friendship It was a gorgeous morning that first day of fifth grade. With the sun happily peeking over the slight wind, my new dress shone with radiance. My heart was pounding deep inside my chest as I walked into the class. I poked my head nervously through the door and surveyed the chaotic scene that lay before me. Kids were rushing about, kids I’d never seen before. I saw her. Anna, with her long blonde hair set back in a headband, her tall athletic frame standing at attention. I could tell right away that she had authority. She was the best, had always been the best, and she knew it. I was intrigued. Nervously, I tiptoed around to the teacher and waited for Anna to notice me. Her cool lips were puckered in a sophisticated pout as she took me in. Her blue-green eyes looked quickly over me with an instant air of dissaproval. I could almost hear her commenting. \"What a baby. A pink sundress? Go back to kindergarten, sweetie.\" Not a great first impression, as these things go, but as time went by, you could almost feel her disgust rising. The first time I had her over was great. We walked to Hy-Vee and laughed the whole way. Anna always made me laugh. We shared our secrets and I felt myself starting to really enjoy her company. After two or three months, we were actually good friends. If only it would have stayed that way. By sixth grade, we had become best friends. I think it hit us both by surprise because we are totally opposite in every way. She’s blond, tall and lean. A rebel. I’m short and dark. Responsible is an understatement. Although we got along well and spent a lot of time together, I always felt inferior around her. It was as if I had to work twice as hard as she did to keep our friendship together. I remember the time my mom took us to the Plaza. We went to the Nature Company. Anna commented on a rock she really liked. I guess she expected my mom to buy it for her, but she didn’t. Later I heard her tell another friend that my mom was a cheap Jew. I’ll never forget the icy pain and shock, the fear that ran through me at that moment. I ran away and cried."
6, "A Bitter Friendship, Continued A Bitter Friendship, Continued Our relationship was much like a tranquil volcano. Everything was fine on the outside, but there was always an underlying current of the disaster that was waiting to happen. To the outsider, we were inseperable. What they didn’t know was that in three years of friendship, she hadn’t invited me over once. I was always the one to do the inviting, the planning. Anna had a best friend before me, but after almost 7 years of friendship, Anna was \"dumped.\" I guess inside I was always wondering if Anna really liked me, or if I was just a simple replacement. By seventh grade, things with Anna were very rocky. I had heard from mutual friends that she had been talking about me behind my back. After a while, it seemed the only nice words spoken were when we were face to face. She was too domineering. She always made me feel stupid. In her mind, she was better and I was worse and that was that. One evening at the beginning of our eighth grade year, the tremor hit. Anna spent the night and the whole evening we watched T.V. or read. We didn’t talk once. Finally I couldn’t stand it anymore. \"Anna,\" I said, \"This is so stupid. We don’t talk, we hardly ever do things together anymore, this friendship has been worn out for a long time.\" \"I’m sorry you feel that way,\" was her only reply. Five minutes later, Anna had left my home and my life. My whole world seems to be more on track now that she’s gone. My self-confidence and my general attitude have improved immensley. I do miss her sometimes. How could I not after three years of friendship? All I can think is that I was a good friend to her. Our relationship didn’t survive, but we’ll always have the laughs… and the tears."
6, "The Last Day of School The Last Day of School The Last Day of School I sat in my desk, sweat dripping down my face. I shut my eyes tight, then opened them. I looked at my watch: 11:27. Three minutes! Three minutes until I heard a sound, a sound that would set me free for three months of total nothingness. Ms. Smith rambled on about pi and figuring out percentages. 11:28. I stared at my watch. I looked as the seconds ticked down to freedom from SCHOOL! 11:29:50. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 BRRRIIINNNGGG! The bell rang! I pulled on my backpack, tore out of the room, sprinted down the stairs, sped down the hallway, and bounded out the door. I dashed home and picked up a snack. I popped a video into the VCR, turned on the TV, and relaxed. Ahhh… what a glorious day!"
6, "Gum: A Vicious Cycle Have you ever noticed that someone is always chewing their last stick of gum? For me it has gotten to the point where I’m starting to believe that gum is bought one stick at a time. Be assured that if you ask someone for gum their reply will be, \"Sorry, this is my last piece.\" A second phase of this strange phenomena is a sudden and inexplicable excess of gum. Every now and then, for no logical reason that I can understand, I will encounter a person who is freely giving out gum. Beware of the stampede call from these people: \"Anyone want some gum?\" This question, simply translated, means \"I have found the mother load of single sticks. Come! Help me chew them.\" The third and most deadly phase is the need for gum. The symptoms start small and grow without warning. They creep up on the victim with: \"Does anyone have some gum?\" Soon the victim realizes that no gum is to be had. He disappears from the playground screaming, \"I need gum! Please help me!\" Years later you find him on a street corner begging. He tugs at your coat, \"Please, can I have a stick of gum?\" You reply: \"Sorry, this is my last piece.\" "
6, "My Mom \"Company halt!\" yelled the drill master. My mom stopped and went into position. Her dog tags clinked as she moved. My mom. I would say she was a true hero. At least I think she is. Her life sort of dazzles me. She told me many stories about how she danced in the Nutcracker in front of the King and Queen when she was seven. Now, my mom wasn’t born in America. She was born in Denmark. She went to America after she married an American man (my dad). But before she met my dad she had an interesting life. Then again she has an interesting future from that time. Some of these things she make her famous to me. I think that my mom is a true hero from all the things she went through. My mom was able to live through a lot of things when she was in the Danish Army. You see when my mom joined the army it was a very pretigious time. Most of the men laughed at her because she was a woman. But she showed them! She survived many wilderness tests that most of the men couldn’t do. She did drills better than anyone! My mom even became the first Danish woman to ride a tank! My mom is in the World Book of records! I think that is really cool! My mom spent four years in the Army then retired. I don’t know if she fought in any war, but she made the surviver list! She also got a ton of medals. I am so proud of my mom. Not a lot of women joined the Army when my mom joined. So in one way my mom is a heroine for all women. After my mom’s encounter with the Army, my mom had a restless life. Three years after mom had retired she met a man named David. They fell in love and a couple months later they got married. \"You may kiss the bride.\" Ewww! After the honeymoon my dad had to go Louisiana. He was still in the Marines and he was stationed there. So they moved to the gator state. Nine months later \"Pop!\" I came into the world. Really, I came a little early, but I’m glad! Who wants to be born on April 15, tax day! Anyway, two years later my dad was restationed to Massachusetts. But another two years later my mom got a diploma at Harvard. There was a big celebration and I ate all of the cake. Burp! Then finally my dad retired from the Marines. He got a lot of medals too. Soon my dad wanted to move again so we moved to Lynnwood and stayed there. Now we live a happy life. Whew! After all this stuff I would pass out! My mom must be very tired! Well, now my mom works with a business that helps people make money. Dad helps her too. I’m in the sixth grade doing a writing exam and everything else is okay. My mom used to have a job, but she wanted to be her own boss. I really think my mom is a hero. She didn’t save the world from aliens. She didn’t stop a bomb. All she did was be herself. She worked hard and had fun. And she still does. So listen people who think they are heroes. Listen up movie stars. This is my mom. My hero. Through all the stuff she went through I think she diserves a gold medal. My mom. My hero. And I know that she will always be."
6, "An Eight Pound Rival \"Oh my God,\" I exclaimed, \"What’s John doing out there? Why is he on his hands and knees, Mom?\" I looked out the big kitchen window, wondering if my eight year old brother was all right. He was on hands and knees in our back yard looking rather distressed. Then he threw up. I ran out to see what happened. John stood up and smiled. I was panicked. \"You have to come inside now! What happened?! I asked, almost screaming. \"I ate too much at breakfast. I want to keep playing. I’m not sick, Ellie!\" He pouted at me for the next five minutes until agreeing to come inside with me or, as I threatened, mom would be mad. The minute we got inside he started acting like an angel. Little brat. I thought. I hate him. This typical incident was just yesterday, but I can still remember the morning of March 2nd, 1969, a day that has affected my life more than I ever could have suspected. To me, a five year old girl, it seemed pretty simple: Mom was having a baby. I couldn’t comprehend the implications this would have on my life. When I woke up that morning I went downstairs to demand breakfast, but, instead, grandma was there, and said bluntly, \"Your mom’s at the hospital having the baby.\" \"Oh,\" I thought, completely unaffected. I called my friend, Jakie, who lived across the yard, to come over and play. Jakie was my best friend, and she flipped out wondering about the baby and what was going on. Then I started to get curious about \"it\" too. My sister, who had already gone through the birth of a younger sibling (me!), seemed less than enthusiastic. I started to miss my mom, something that had rarely happened before. When Coral, my mom and Dad’s closest friend, pulled up in our driveway, everyone told me that we were going to the hospital to see my mom and my new brother. I felt my first pangs of jealousy. We all ran to see my mom, who had been in labor all night. I jumped right into the bed next to my exhausted mother as soon as we got into her room. My brother was being weighed and measured, but we got to hold him soon. I was secretly scared because he was so small and delicate. He looked sort of gross, but everyone else seemed to love him, so I didn’t say anything. You could barely see his face because of all the wrinkles. Gross! I thought in disgust! His whole body was covered in wrinkles, and he was on the redish side. We decided to call him John Jordan Strosahl. John (now \"Johnny-Jordan\") grew up to be a superbly cute baby — to my disappointment. He had golden blonde baby curls spilling off his head which reminded me of the foam on a coke. Big, round, sapphire eyes lit up his face — as if he need it with such a great big, gummy smile. That’s what has bugged me most for all these years. Frankly, John was the cutest baby, and I knew that the amount of doting time we got wasn’t equal; this made me pretty mad."
6, "An Eight Pound Rival, Continued For the next eight years, John dominated all the attention. Every time there was an argument, or even a fight, Mom took John’s side. I had to share a room with A.J., my older sister, for a while after John was born, and then I had to share a room with the Devil himself. I was not impressed. So what? Yeah, he’s extremely cute and only four years old, but he was annoying me!!!!! Who made up the rules about how the youngest gets first priority and who gets to start off in mom’s bed anyway? In fifth grade, I expressed my resentment in a poem: My brother is on the bed right next to me. He’s singing and playing his new kazoo And making me mad all at the same time. I want him to SHUT UP!!! He’s telling me how much better at things he is than me. He’s putting down his Kazoo. YES! But now he’s hitting the cat. I take his kazoo and start hitting him with it. My Mom comes in the room and starts yelling at ME. Jeeze. Through all this I didn’t realize how much I loved him. Even being the attention-stealer that he was, he was a good companion, also. We had so much fun goofing off together, and I loved playing airplane with him. This was a game where I put him on my legs and he pretended to be flying. John grew up to be a lot like me which made us extremely compatible, but it was hard because I had to share the limelight. He was very silly and a natural performer, so I felt like there was no more room for my silliness; he took silliness to a whole new level. John and I were frequently sent from the dinner table for being loud, obnoxious, or rowdy. Most times we left the table snickering, and ready to play some more. I was especially good at bullying him and that made me feel better about having to share the limelight. I really enjoyed having a buddy everywhere that I went with the family, even if I wasn’t nice to him all the time. I really do love him and always will. He is very entertaining and funny and he has a good heart. I’m trying to accept that he didn’t mean to dominate the center stage all the time, that’s just one of the many lovable assets of his personality. Now, I’m looking at John, over the mess on the kitchen table, wondering if he’s all right, because he’s only eight years old, and that was a lot of throwing up to do. Then he gets to go out and play with his friend, just like he wanted. I feel a little cheated. Would I have gotten to go back out if that was me? I really wish he could have the experience of a younger sibling, just so he would know how I feel."
6, "The Food War Simon Wilken was snacking down on a plum with great gusto. He kept a heavy supply of them in his room. Some of the plums he ate weren’t finished; they littered the carpet under his king size bed. Simon’s favorite fruit and vegetables were part of his everyday life. His parents thought good nutrition was important so they owned a fruit & vegetable store and literally stuffed their son until he’d burst. When Simon went with his family to their cabin, the pantry back at home came to life. Bananas formed a crude ladder to the floor. Grapes tumbled down to form a cushion. The pineapple almost made a dent in the floor as he came down. Quickly as they fell, the oranges and apples scrambled into a cupboard and came out with scissors. The raisins didn’t stay long in that suffocating bag. The brave and gallant colonel mango led the procession into the kitchen while the kiwis defended the rear. Mushroom scouts peered into binoculars from their perches on top of the refrigerator. They noted the movements of the great fruit horde and calculated where they were going. Half of them fell back and reported to the head tomato. \"Sir, the ‘orde is moving southeast at a fast march. I reckon they’re goin’ fer the stairs.\" \"Dismissed,\" came the reply of the tomato. He ordered the carrot to send a couple of radish messengers to the pineapple and ask him what he was doing. The strong radishes scaled the refrigerator with surprising agility and speed. They wanted to make sure the pineapple saw the white flag. A couple of strawberry guards escorted the radishes to the makeshift tent the pineapple was in. \"Sir,\" came the voice of a strawberry, \"three radish messengers to see you.\" \"Send ‘em,\" the pineapple requested. The radishes were hesitant and stammered but somehow got out their message. \"E chief toomato want t’know whurr you’re goin’.\" \"Tell him we were going to rescue the casualty plums up in the monster’s room. We hate it when plums are half eaten and thrown about. Either no plum should be eaten or all of a plum should be eaten,\" stated the head fruit. \"Your master, Chief Tomato, can come with us if he wants.\" \"Thank’ou kindly, zurr,\" came the grateful reply from the radishes as they climbed quite easily up the piece of lettuce that hung down for them. Soon the whole vegetation mass swarmed the refrigerator to join the fruit horde on their dangerous mission. Greetings were made and as quickly as they met they were off. A dozen onions and peaches rounded the doorway to the stairs. A horrifying shock met them. A huge orange tabby was perched on the stairs snoring loudly. I watched through half closed eyes and kept up the pantomime. This is the introduction. The full story continues for over 20 pages!"
6, "The Day I Went Down Sand Hill One thing that changed my life forever would have to be the day I went down sand hill. It was summer, and like most summers it was stiflingly humid. It all started about 8:00 A.M. It was hot enough to fry bacon on the sidewalk, not to mention my brain, so I went to ask my mother if I could go down to Church Lake. She didn’t see any reason not to go, so she said it was all right. I asked Anthony if he wanted to come with me, and he did. Both of us, in a fit of excitement, raced for our bikes in anticipation of the cool slap of water against our bodies. We had no idea that something really bad was going to happen, so we raced ahead to see who would get there first. He was in the lead, ahead of me about three feet when I noticed that the big hill was approaching. We stopped at the top of the hill and looked down at the curving surface of the road. Excitedly we both took off down the hill, our bodies stiff with adrenaline, and the pure glory of going 40 miles per hour on our bikes. The wind hit our faces with soothing coolness as we raced down the hill, but then I noticed that I was about to crash in to a corner. In a fit of panic I slammed on the brakes, in hopes of escaping the fate of crashing, but the tire locked up, and I started to skid out of control. I fell off my bike and started using my bare leg to stop me from crashing into the ditch, but as most people know, skin, blood, and muscle don’t make good brakes. As I was tearing up my leg, my life seemed to flash before my eyes. Bits of memories crammed in between my screams of anguish and pain. When I approached the bottom I stopped sliding. I got up and took a look at my leg. There, where a perfectly good leg had been, was a bloody mess with pieces of road bonded in with muscle tissue. Staring with horror I screamed. A passerby heard me and saw my leg. All the while, Anthony just stared at me like the dolt that he is. The guy that saw me took us home. Now every time I approach a hill I am cautious."
6, "Poor Bill... A Hard Worker: Bill Gates orker: Bill Gates You all know Bill Gates. When you hear that name you think \"Billionaire\" or \"Lucky,\" but you haven’t really looked deep enough. Bill is more than a rich, lucky businessman. He has worked very hard to get where he is today. When he was in college, he thought long and hard about a problem. And then he thought of how to fix it. Bill Gates is an inventor. He did what all inventors do: they think of a problem, and invent a way to make it better or easier. Bill thought of computers, how they didn’t do anything that an ordinary person could use them for. So Bill invented software for a computer. All of a sudden, people could make spreadsheets to handle calculations! They could type things just like a typewriter except with perfect erasing tools! But before this happened, work was necessary. Bill and a friend or two spent all of their working (and sometimes sleeping) hours working on turning this dream into reality, and after months of intense work they finally finished with products that helped millions of people worldwide. Being an inventor is great, but to profit from it you must be a good businessman. And Bill Gates is that, also. Not only is he good at business, he is good at marketing and advertising. That is how he was able to get some of the smartest minds in the United States to join his entrepreneurial escapade, Microsoft. That good business mind of Bill’s soon had his company selling a whole lot of this new \"software\" to people around the United States. Still, Bill released breakthrough after breakthrough, introducing Windows, a software program designed to make personal computers even more user friendly. And making billions of dollars didn’t stop him. If most people were him, they would probably just leave the company and say, \"I don’t need to deal with this anymore; I’m a billionaire!\" But Bill Gates stays at Microsoft, even being attacked by lawyers, worrying about other competition, and trying to stay ahead. Business is really war. Today he still faces a score of problems. People confronting him in anti-trust lawsuits, and other companies trying hard to pull Microsoft down from its \"king-of-the-hill\" position. Many people still think Bill is so lucky and that he has it easy, but he doesn’t. Money isn’t everything. Bill Gates is my hero because he is a hard worker, and a smart and careful thinker. If I had to choose someone whom I respect a whole lot, it would have to be him. Never giving up, always working on and on, putting up with the criticism. Putting up with the public’s opinion of him. Just letting them push him around when he could just say, \"That’s it. I quit!\" and leave. Still, he goes through with this every day. And people say he has it easy. Wow, I don’t want to know what their idea of \"hard\" is!"
6, "My Little Fat Friend My Little Fat Friend Surprised at what he looked like, I found out what love at first sight truly means. I had been wanting a pug since I was four. To my amazement I would get one. As my parents, my friend, Randi, and I drove up the gravel path of my mom’s old work partner Nancy Degraff, I found out what all my hard work had paid off for. Opening the door of our red car my heart was pounding rapidly. Inside the house I could hear the soft barks of two small girl pugs which were the grandmother, Porcia, and her half sister, Munchy. Hearing the barks of their Jack Russel Terrier, Nancy helped me find out which bark belonged to the pug I would get. Walking up to the door and hearing the soft crackling under my feet, I could see the dark shadows racing about the old house. \"Come on in,\" a sweet voice called. As we walked in it felt like one hundred little dogs were zooming around me licking me, rubbing against my legs, and trying to get on my lap. As Nancy cleared away all but the one I wanted, she announced, \"This is Sherman.\" As I looked at him my heart melted. Looking at his little smudged in face, and little white spot on his chest, I just about died. His all black fur and the cock of his head made me run over to him and throw my arms around his chubby little body. One thing did stand out about him. He was way bigger than I had ever imagined he would be. Even though he was chunky, I still loved him. I learned that Sherman’s not like other dogs. He’s got his own way of doing things, and his own way of looking. That’s what makes him special. Yet to my surprise he’s the perfect dog in every way."
6, "My Hero: Jay Buhner  The deafening crowd was packed into the Kingdome on sold-out Buhner Buzz-Cut Night. Hundreds of people were outfitted in brand new buzz-cuts and were enjoying the Mariner game. \"And now, Jay Buhner!\" the announcer blared over the microphone. The friendly, 6 foot 3 inch fisherman slowly stepped to the plate. The first pitch was fired over like a bullet from a gun. \"Jay swings, connects, and belts the ball deep into left field. It’s going, going, gone! Goodbye baseball! Another homerun for Jay Buhner!\" the announcer bellowed, excitement running through his voice. This is why Jay Buhner is my hero. He’s pounded over forty home runs, three years in a row, and has achieved many other amazing feats, too. Jay hit a 479 foot homer at the new Yankee stadium on July 25th, 1991, the longest hit in its history. He was the first Mariner to hit for the Cycle (a single, a double, a triple, and a homerun in one game), on June 23rd, 1993 against the Oakland A’s. In 1996, Jay earned his first Gold Glove award. Last season, at an exhilarating game in Fenway Park, he vaulted over the wall in right field into the bullpen to catch what would have been a colossal home run. Jay Buhner is happily married, and has one son, Gunnar. Issaquah is his pleasant home in the off-season. He drives the best sport-utility vehicle ever made, a rugged Hummer. That is exactly the car I’d get if I had all his money. I think that Jay Buhner is a true hero. The Seattle Mariners would be lacking an excellent right fielder without him. I hope he stays in Seattle for the rest of his baseball career."
6, "The champagne bubbles up overflowing the crystal wine flutes. Suddenly, the doors to the limo open unfurling a sea of flashing lights. * * * A flash of lightning illuminates the harsh emptiness of the night. In an orphanage children cry mournfully. They are starving. * * * A deep plush, red carpet floods your eyes. Smiles, laughter, cheers bombard the senses. A happiness unknown before now thrives within you. * * * The mud runs thick beneath you in this stench-filled alley. Rain batters your body. With each step your feet plunge into the thick goo. You tug at your feet to relinquish them from the mud and each time you whisper, \"just one more\" but you must keep going for the children wait. * * * You feel as though your feet are gliding across the ground. You’re now waiting, the two people on stage say, \"and now the Oscar for best actor goes to…\" then an ominous silence flushes through the building. The anxiety within you bubbles and churns, as you almost let out a scream of anticipation that just couldn’t be held in when your name is announced for the world to hear. You jump into the air and throw your hands up. As you stare blindly out at the crowd all you see are their eyes staring back at you with praise and congratulations. Your whole body is numb with happiness. * * * The door to home is a bombed-out hole in the wall. All you carry with you are two loaves of bread. Inside you are met with a void of darkness. From a corner the flicker of a candle dimly lights the room. 30 children await food. Now all you feel is sadness. * * * These are two different people in two different worlds. One a celebrity, why? He’s seen around the world, mobbed wherever he goes, his every move is the paparazzi’s life. The other a hero, why? He is selfless. He chose to walk down a different path in life, a path of hardships, poverty, and hunger. Someone doesn’t have to be a superhero to be like this. He could be a five-year old giving up his allowance, or a person becoming a mentor, or someone’s grandma taking in a stray dog. These are the everyday heroes. A celebrity, on the other hand, is famous. Not for some humanitarian act but for acting. Acting is the art of becoming someone you aren’t. Just because you portray a hero doesn’t mean you become one. An actor acts. A hero helps. The actor becomes famous and the hero does not. And that’s just it: heroes don’t care about the credit they just care."
6, "Cheaper Products? But at What Cost? Right now I want you to pretend you are in a store. As you walk around, you see that some products are much less expensive than others. Now, look at the labels on these cheaper items. You will probably notice that many of these labels say, \"Made in China,\" or \"Made in Honduras.\" Have you ever stopped to wonder why products made in these countries are so much more affordable than things manufactured right here on American soil? Well, before you buy another inexpensive article of clothing, pair of shoes, sporting good, carpet, or any other product, you might want to think this through. Child labor has long been banned in America, but out of sight should not mean out of mind. Over 200 million children world-wide work full time in conditions not fit for an animal. That means that they do not play sports, they do not attend school, and they do not have fun. These children are prisoners. Take, for example, Pakistan and India. In these countries, a \"bonded labor\" system forces child laborers, some as young as four years old, to work for a single employer for many years. They are sometimes literally tied to their loom to ensure they are not slacking off. In return for their servitude, they receive a place to sleep and just enough food to sustain them. In Honduras, 13% of the workforce is between 12 and 15 years old. There are no laws restricting the ages of the employees, nor are there any limits on the hours they can work. It is not uncommon for a 13 year old child to put in a 14 hour day with no break. However, Honduran employers are required to have a night school for their young laborers to attend. Children put to work weaving carpets, making soap, or any other number of jobs are never paid in full for their toil. Here in the U.S., the minimum wage is over five dollars an hour. In countries that hire minors to do the dirty work there is almost never a minimum pay requirement. In Haiti, children are, on average, paid 28 cents per hour. In Sri Lanka, the median is 18 cents. Vietnamese and Chinese children should not expect their wages to exceed 11 cents. These numbers are truly tragic. Before you buy something made in a country that condones the labor of young children who work for pennies just so that you can have a more inexpensive item, please think about the situation you are contributing to."
6, "Walking home from my bus stop is often an adventure. I never know when I am going to encounter a big dog, an angry neighbor, or perhaps even a killer tree. It was a beautiful day. The sky was blue with only a few lacy clouds, the air was cool and fresh. Crisp leaves were crackling beneath my feet. It would have been a wonderful day to walk slowly, enjoying the weather. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my coat and the otherwise nice weather was chilling me to the bone. To make matters worse, my back was hurting from a ligament I pulled during soccer practice earlier in the week. So despite the pleasant surroundings, I was feeling rather miserable. Then my mind began to wander, as it often does. I began to think of my science class where we were studying the brain and had just discussed the idea of hypnosis helping with minor pain. I also remembered that hypnosis and meditation were similar. Thinking of this reminded of a talk I’d once had with my step-dad about meditation. I put these thoughts together and came up with my great idea for the day: to relieve my suffering from the cold and my back pain, I would meditate while walking home. Being the whimsical person I am, I decided that I would try this idea, disregarding the protests of the saner, more logical voice in my head. To begin with, I concentrated on warmth. I thought of fires, of warm houses, of summertime. I slowed my breathing to promote a more relaxed state. It was all going rather well, I was actually feeling warmer and my back wasn’t bothering me as much. I smiled. Then I realized my nose hurt. A few seconds later I figured out the cause: I had run into a tree. Not just any tree, but a big rough-barked tree. I immediately jumped away, hopping in a circle, yelping with pain. Next I sat down and felt my nose to make sure it wasn’t flattened (it wasn’t). To show the tree my rage, I kicked it, resulting in a hurt foot. I glared at it menacingly, figuring that it couldn’t hurt me any more if I just looked at it. I’m sure the big dogs and angry neighbors were all getting a good laugh by now. And so I continued home: cold, aching back, hurt nose, bruised foot. Note to self: no more meditating while walking."
6, "Where There’s a Rill There’s a Way The Life of Randy the Rill The Life of Randy the Rill The Life of Randy the Rill Hi, my name is Randy the Rill. You may not have heard that word before, so here’s a little background. A rill is a very small stream. Some rills are the kind that just drain an area when it rains. That is important, so there won’t be floods. My sister, Rhonda the Rill, is of this type. But, aaahh, back to me. I’m pretty important, too, ya know. I drain a small pond just east of Wilkeson. If I wasn’t here, he’d just burst. Besides keeping that guy in business, I also support a variety of animal life. There is a family of deer that lives on the ridge above me that consists of a mom and two fawns. I occasionally see the father around also. But every morning, those two cuties come down to one of my larger pools to drink. Boy, that really tickles! At least they don’t wade through me. I also support a healthy population of cutthroat and resident steelhead. There is a population of caddis and mayflies that also hatch here. The fish I mentioned earlier do a good job of keeping them under control. In turn, the fish are the first choice of the raccoon family (you should see the little tikes try to catch those cutthroat). Some other animals that I support are salamanders, toads, frogs, snakes, rabbits, and squirrels. I also support many plant varieties. The ferns do a good job of keeping my waters cool, and the old spruce log that fell built a pool with a nice cascading waterfall that does a good job aerating my waters, along with the other waterfalls I own. The pool I just mentioned is deep, with a pebbly bottom, and crystal clear water. The wide selection of moss and lichen does a good job of keeping the soil around me from eroding away. The lush forest around me is perhaps the prettiest in the world. The wild blue huckleberry around me is in full strength. On a warm sunny day, I can smell the light fragrance of them. In the lower reaches of me, I meander through a little dell, lush with tiny grand fir only 2 ft. high, huckleberry, and wandering strawberry. The bright green club moss is in abundance here, carpeting the fertile topsoil. Here and there a little red newt pauses in it’s courting, and when alarmed, scurries for the shelter of a nearby nursery log, where wild mushrooms sprout up like groups of little elf umbrellas. Under a nearby fir, a small mouse pauses in it’s search for food, where rattlesnake plantain produces perfect cover. In the open, where the sun has penetrated the old growth spruce, wild mint and clover create a sweet smelling perfume. Another plant I’ll mention is — My gosh, is that thunder I hear? That pond is in for a beating now! Well, no time to talk! I have a pond to drain. Will I ever rest?"
6, "Teenage Nostalgia I can’t remember the first time I climbed that tree, or even any time that I wasn’t able to. It was a mulberry tree, growing between my house and the Smith’s house. Actually, it was a little closer to theirs. It wasn’t always the center of our play — we played other games like hide and seek, baseball, tag, leaf fights, we had mulberry feasts — but it was always there. Ty, the oldest, would climb up close to the top, then Lisa, second, then Tanner, who is actually the youngest, and finally me, content on the first or second branch. I remember jumping contests and strange pulley-like contraptions to haul mulberries, and some autumn days when we just collected the leaves and made beds out of them with blankets we had snuck from the house. We would convince ourselves that we could spend the night out there in our leaf beds, but it never happened. About once a year, Mr. Smith would get some idea that he wanted to cut down the tree, and every year, we would all scream and gasp, \"No! You can’t!\" One year, he even managed to get out his chainsaw and walk up to it before we all ran out, me from my house, Lisa and Tanner and Ty from theirs, yelling and screaming and standing in front of it. I don’t think he ever would have actually cut it down, but he wouldn’t give up without an argument from all of us. I think he let us win and brought it up the next year just to see what we would do. Another game, I guess. Growing up the way I did, I will always think that my childhood was the best that anyone could ever have. I went to kindergarten and elementary school and middle school in Camden, but I grew up in Lagrange, with Lisa and Tanner and the tree, in my house on the river. I am not nearly an adult now, but I have already grown up. It will never be like that again. It will never be like anything more than once, so the only thing to do is enjoy every moment of life, no matter what, because in the next minute, it will change and you will be on to a new part. Everything is a memory, and while I sit here reminiscing over what was then, I know I’ll be reminiscing again in just a few years over what I am doing right now. My father says that the day a thirteen year old is nostalgic, he will fly around the world. Well, Dad, you better start your trip. It’s still three days until my fourteenth birthday."
6, "The explosions and gunshots were definitely getting worse. Not only was the enemy advancing, the scatterfire was starting to take a toll on the men. Lieutenant Jim Osborne was running out of options. He ordered the tanks to take out enemy clusters and to destroy the missile trucks coming this way. He then ordered an airstrike of the surrounding area, hoping to finish this soon. He called a general retreat, took out some troops coming from behind a dune, and then retreated himself. He could already hear the roar of the F-16 coming this way. 20 minutes later it was over, but the scene would forever etch itself into Jim’s mind. 19 troops dead, and more than 80% of the rest injured. The U.S. would pay dearly for this. In 1990, most of America knew when we routed Iraq’s army. How we got away almost unscathed. Almost. My Uncle, Lieutenant Jim Osborne’s unit, the Falcons, was once one of the best fighting units in the Marines. They would infiltrate enemy missile silos, destroy chemical plants, and otherwise make themselves a thorn in the lion’s paw. But it all changed during the Gulf War. Their mission was Top Secret: my Uncle still cannot tell me what he did, but they infiltrated Iraq’s eastern borders on November 29th, 1989. They stayed hidden for about 6 weeks, not seeing anyone until the enemy just sort of showed up. They ambushed the Falcons and basically slaughtered them. It was horrible, a black mark on America’s military record. After that, the Falcons who survived were disbanded, and everyone was sent home. When my Uncle came home, you could see the shadows beneath his eyes, a haunted, frightening face looked upon you as you gazed back up at him. He had taken a bullet in his arm, which was slinged, and a deep scratch etched itself in his face, and he looked old and warn. I was 5½ at the time, and, not understanding what had just happened to my Uncle, I ran to him, and asked him what happened to his arm. He told me he got hurt, but that he would stay home now. My family came up behind me with tears in their eyes, and they hugged him, and told him they loved him. He stayed at my house for about a year after that, trying to get enough to buy a house of his own. When I was older, he told me what really happened. His troop had come out of some foothills when approximately 300 Iraqi soldiers ambushed them. Jim’s troops were slaughtered, and Jim himself was lucky to make it out alive. He would have flashbacks every once in a while afterwards, too. It would be horrible to watch him, it was like someone watching a horror movie without anyone else seeing it. Six years after Jim got back, he got married to Susan Patchler, a woman who knew one of his troops in the Gulf War. They bought a house together, and I think their son just turned 3. Jim had gotten his life together in just six years after being psychologically unfit to live on his own. And that’s why I admire Jim so much. In the Gulf War he was a brave leader. Afterwards, he had the courage to live with his skeletons over and over again. He got his life back. I don’t know if I would have the courage to do that. Jim is so strong, it makes my mother cry every time we talk about it. I fashion my life after my uncle, even though I doubt I would be staying as strong as he. I secretly wish I was. Because someone who works from his lowest point up to a life filled with family and friends is someone who is richer than Bill Gates by far! He earned his life, and loves it dearly. He would risk everything if he could save it. I salute you, Lieutenant Jim Osborne. May your bravery and courage be passed on so that someone else may look up to you and yours, and honor them as I do."	
9, "What Do I Have To Look Forward To? I’ve never understood why so many of my friends were in such a hurry to grow up. When I look around at the adults I know, growing up doesn’t seem like much fun. My parents always seem worried about things. If it’s not me or my brother, it’s the house or the car or work, or something having to do with one of their parents. And other adults don’t seem much happier either. My friend’s parents seem to have just as many problems to deal with. Whenever I visit after school, the moms look tired, and you can forget about even talking to the dads for a couple of hours after they get home from work, if they even get home at all. (In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever met the fathers of some of my friends. It’s as though they don’t even exist.) I’m not saying that every adult I know is like this. It’s just that most adults never seem to really be able to enjoy anything without worrying about it, too. No matter what I’m doing with my parents, they always seem bothered by the thought that something bad might happen, or that they might be doing something wrong. Sometimes things do go wrong, but mostly things turn out OK. Nothing really bad has ever happened in our family, but my parents always seem nervous about things, or unsure of themselves, as though they don’t really know what they’re doing. From my point of view, being an adult doesn’t look so good. Get up, go to work, come home, go to sleep, try to get the kids to do whatever it is you want them to do. And on the weekends maybe you get up a little later, but it’s basically the same thing: work around the house, take care of the kids, etc. Who wants to do that? I look at everything my parents have to do and I wonder what’s the point? Is this really what I have to look forward to? I guess it’s hard being an adult. When you’re an adult, you’re in the middle, and there’s no one to help you out on either end. You’ve got kids and parents to take care of, and nobody around to take care of you. I guess the hardest part for me in imagining what life will be like when I grow up is looking at all the adults I know now, and not seeing anyone who seems really happy. I don’t know a single adult who likes their job: my mom and dad don’t, my friends’ parents don’t, and I don’t think my teachers do either. All I ever hear from adults are complaints. And even though I know most parents really love their children, they don’t seem to show it very much, and so I wonder if having children is really as terrific as everyone says it is. Everybody’s always talking about adults being good role models for kids, but maybe kids should be models for them. Maybe we could teach them a few things about how to have a good time and enjoy life. It’s worth a try. I’d hate to think that the way growing up seems to me now is the way it’s going to be when I get there."
9, "Friends for Life 57 He was great, a one-of-a-kind guy. Stand-up, Church-going, humble, butt-kicking kind-of guy, that John Lytle, Lytle with a ‘y’, thank you very much. John Lytle, my brother, blood -brother that is. I knew him through fourth and fifth-grade, when we lived in Gresham. He was a friend of a friend, and when we met, we just hit it off. We were best friends. We knew each other for only three months before we started acting like we’d known each other all our lives. Three months into the fourth-grade before we decided we’d wanted to be blood-brothers, and were going to do it pretty much like the Indians had. So, we set it for the next Friday night, when I was staying the night at his house. Friday approached, and finally arrived. At 11:45 pm, when all was quiet and his parents were asleep, we crept out to the hollow in the woods, just in back of John’s house. With us, we took two candles, a small, stainless steel pen-knife, two large bottles of root-beer, and a small book of matches. We packed all of this in a small blanket. At 11:55 pm., we arrived at the hollow, and began setting up. We laid the blanket down and put the candles down into the moist dirt at both ends. At 11:58 pm., we started. First we did sort of a chant we wrote. It read: \"I (Mark, John) do solemnly swear, body and soul, to defend my blood-brother and help him in time of need, and to keep him clean and good.\" We read this at the same time, and, when finished, shook right hands while putting the left one on each other’s shoulder. We then lit the candles. After that, we got on our knees in the middle of the blanket. First John used the pen-knife, then I. We both made a small incision in the middle finer of our right hands. A moment later, at midnight, we pressed our incisioned fingers together and let the blood flow into the other. At a minute past midnight, we were brothers. We took out the root-beer and toasted each other and our newfound brotherhood. After that it seemed we had a mind link. We knew when the other was angry and didn’t wish to converse with anyone. But again we knew when the other needed someone to talk to, if they were depressed or whatever. But we always just automatically knew when we saw each other. We never had to say a thing. We knew when we were around each other too much, when we needed a week or two with our other friends. Because of this, this way we realized we needed time off from one another, I think we were better friends than most. However, aside from being blood-brothers and American, we really didn’t have that much in common. He liked the Beatles, I liked Hall & Oates. And while he was darker in skin and hair color, and a little shorter, too, I was sort of fair haired and light-skinned, and a little taller than he is. From our friendship, I know now what they mean by opposites attract. John was the best kid I ever knew. There when I need him, gone when he knew I needed to be alone. And I feel darn privileged of having the extreme honor of being his blood-brother. I just wish we could have carted him along when we moved here to Canby. God bless his soul. I’m never going to forget him."
9, "In my old, battered black wallet I carry many things. A letter from a friend. My lunch ticket. My social security card. Many other tidbits and items as well. There is one thing however, which I prize above all my possessions. It is a photograph. It’s small, and the photographer was not good. That does not matter. What matters is the person in the photograph. His name is Bill Stevenson. We first met almost two years ago, when I moved to Vancouver. It was my first day and the school was the largest I had ever been to. I was nervous. I walked into my first class slightly late. I took a seat. Looking around, I noticed several people staring at me. I don’t like to be stared at, so I was uncomfortable. Since it was the first day of junior high, the teacher took it easy on us. We played a game of what is called Trivial Pursuit. The room was divided in half for teams. The person behind me, a muscular blond guy, made polite conversation. When a question came to him, he answered it correctly. \"Guess how I knew that?\" he challenged. I confessed I didn’t know. \"We have the game at home,\" he said grinning widely. \"I’ve had that question before.\" So, that little picture is my prized possession. It reminds me of my best friend and his family. Whenever I see it, I think of Bill. And then I laugh. Bill Stevenson, your quite a friend."
9, "In Praise of Ancient Vehicles As I step out of the pick-up it hits me, the smell of manure drifting down from the barn. A sliding glass door swishes open, and clomping down the ramp is my boss, Robert Taylor. \"Put your lunch in the van, Steve. I’ll be there in a minute.\" I turn and walk toward the van, an old ’69 green and white Dodge Sportsman, covered with an inch of dust. When I open the door and peer in, it reminds me of a walk-in trash can. The floor lies out of sight underneath a sea of garbage. I kick some garbage out of my way and hop up in the seat. Before long, here comes Rob, clomping across the driveway. He opens the door, groans as he gets up into his seat, cranks the motor over, and the motor sputters to a start, filling the air inside the van with the smell of burnt oil. My first impression is that we won’t make it out of the driveway, but we sputter out onto the road, and head toward town. When we pull into the circular drive, I peer through the dust-smudged window to find that the tractor is still there. On the side it reads \"Massey-Ferguson,\" but with Robert, it’s hard telling what it really is. As I sit down in the seat I adjust the hunk of foam rubber to a comfortable position. Once I have accomplished this, I sit down and start cranking on the prehistoric starter. Slowly, and then more rapidly, like a steam engine building up speed, the black smoke rolls out of the pipe functioning as a muffler and away we go."
9, "Harder Than You Think  I walk up the hill with my friends, then turn into our cul-de-sac, go to the front door, put the key in the lock, turn, and step in. The house breathes a kind of spooky hello as I set my books down and go to the kitchen where the inevitable note is waiting: \"Have a snack. Be home soon. I love you.\" As I’m munching cookies, I think how I’d like to go out and shoot a few hoops if I had someone to do it with. You can play Nintendo by yourself, but it isn’t the same. So I forget that for now. I should be doing my Spanish homework anyway. Too bad I don’t have an older brother or sister to help conjugate all those dumb verbs. I could call a friend, sure, but if I had a brother or sister, I’d have a built-in friend. While I’m feeling so sorry for myself, I hear my friends Denise and Kevin across the street. She’s screaming bloody murder because he is throwing leaves in her hair and threatening to put a beetle in her backpack. She has just stepped on his new Nikes. I do not have these squabbles. I guess the big advantage, if you call it that, to being an only child is that my life is my own, nobody \"borrows\" my CDs or my books or my clothes. I also get a bigger allowance than I probably would if I had siblings. My parents take me everywhere, from the mall to the East Coast. Maybe they wouldn’t if they had other kids. (On the other hand, it would be more fun going if I had someone my own age.) All these great advantages are overshadowed by one big disadvantage, though, and it’s the main reason I would change things if I could. When you are an only child, your parents depend on you to be the big success all the time. You are their big hope, so you cannot fail. You have to be good at sports, popular, and have good grades. You need a career goal. You have to have neat hair and clothes that look pressed. You have to have good grammar, clean socks, good breath, and table manners. If you’ve ever felt jealous of somebody who is an only child, don’t. It’s a lot of pressure. I often wish for a little screw-up brother or sister my parents could worry about for a while. So, while having a neat room with nothing disturbed is great, I’d take a brother or sister in a minute if I could. The big irony is, if I had that mythical brother or sister, I would probably be wishing myself an only child again the first time my baseball shirt didn’t come back or my stereo got broken. Life is like that. What you don’t have always seems to be the thing you want."
9, "An Education Lasts a Lifetime An Education Lasts a Lifetime Education is a key element in developing the skills necessary for a successful life. Too often students are more involved earning a paycheck than spending time on their academic studies. Students need to realize that their high school classes will prepare them for a brighter future. A high school student’s time is very limited. Homework and extra curricular activities are time consuming and if a student adds a job into this busy schedule, less time is devoted to their academic studies. The effects of this could be receiving lower grades or not taking challenging courses. A job would also limit the amount of time a teenager has for social activities and sports, thereby causing a withdrawal from friends and the high school community. The job environment is not always beneficial to the student. In most cases the wages are low and the hours are long. Sometimes employers can be very demanding and schedules are not flexible. The skills being used may not be beneficial in furthering their career, and they might become comfortable with the paycheck and not strive to reach their full potential. Money is the root of many problems associated with teenagers. A paycheck gives a student the power to purchase many commodities including cars, clothing and electronics. They may also be exposed to drugs and alcohol. Students are being introduced to a new environment and the challenge of managing their money comes into play. Teenagers already have enough pressures and stress in their lives and they may find it difficult to juggle academics along with their work schedule. High school is a time of growth both mentally and physically. Students should focus their attention on their studies so they can one day achieve their dreams."
9, "Dusty Books Dusty Books The smell of old, dusty books reminds me of my father. An avid collector, he had many books, most of which went unread. He owned books on everything from medicine to Vietnam to several sets of encyclopedias. When I enter one of his haunts, such as Powell’s, I am carried back to a time when the two of us were happy. I see him standing by a shelf, thumbing through a medical journal, or opening his wallet to pay for yet another purchase, knowing full well that Mom would lecture him on \"wasting money on books you never read anyways!\" Strolling past rows and rows of books, I remember how, after the cancer struck, he came less and less and read fewer and fewer books. They became just part of the scenery, collecting only dust and memories. Near the end, perhaps knowing he would never get to read them all, he gave almost all of the books away, keeping only a few and treating them with an almost holy reverence, as if any crease or mar would destroy them totally. Gone was the man who would brush aside a huge coffee stain, replaced by one who would fly into terrible rages at a bent corner or creased spine. I have read a few now, after he is gone, and each time it brings back a hurt like a sore that refuses to heal. But I suppose it is a quest of sorts, because if I can take on his thirst for knowledge, cheerful smile, and willingness to help others, then like a match in the darkness, I will bring a little light into the world. And if that light touches others, maybe it will spread far and wide, to light up the heavens for millennia to come. I think he’d like that."
9,"Will was Right The sweat on your brow. A layer of dust on your face. Out in the woods. Somewhere. And on a horse. Of all the places in the world, I feel best on a horse. Listening to the clip-clop of the hooves. Swatting at flies. (Which probably doesn’t sound appealing to most people but, when you’re on a horse, everything’s enjoyable, even swatting flies!) Not everyone likes being around horses, which is hard for me to understand. Some people are deathly afraid of them. The girl I’m going to tell you about is one of those people. Two years ago, I went on a four-hour ride, my longest yet. I remember it distinctly. We were at Simpson Stables, just at the edge of the Mt. Henderson wilderness area. Only one other person would go on the ride besides the trail guide. Her name was Jennifer. I think she was 11 or 12 years old and I doubt she had ever been on a horse in her life. At first I thought she must be a pretty good rider because she had great boots and she was, after all, on the four-hour ride. I was soon proven wrong. I mounted Pal, my mighty, beautiful, smart horse, with no problem. Jennifer, on the other hand, didn’t have any luck. With the help of two trail hands, the red-faced girl finally got her foot in the stirrup. Then, with one last might heave, the dazed Jennifer struggled the rest of the way onto her weak, ugly, dumb-as-a-doornail horse, Van. The name explains him completely. (Just think of an old, beige, Volkswagen van.) As soon as Jennifer got on her beige Volkswagen, her proud rancher-type grandpa and not-so-rancher-type grandma came to take a picture. She managed a faint smile. Then Van shook his head and snorted, and Jennifer grew pale and grabbed the saddle horn tight. After that, I realized that the only reason she’d agreed to the trail ride was to please rancher-gramps. As we headed away from the gate, the sun felt warm on our backs. Birds flew everywhere. Jennifer, however, wasn’t enjoying any of this. Getting on was only the beginning of her troubles. Whenever we loped the horses, Jennifer would hold Van in check, screaming at the top of her lungs for him to slow down. No wonder we didn’t see any deer. Half an hour after setting out on the trail, I lost faith in the trail guide, too. He took out a round container from his back pocket, opened the lid and pulled out a wad of tobacco. After a minute or so, a long stream of tobacco juice shot from his mouth, gumming up the nearby grass and trees. And as if that wasn’t enough, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and lit up — in the middle of a dry, drought-stricken forest! There went all my faith in the only other normal person on the ride, blowing away like his cigarette ashes. I thought he must be insane. I was sure the whole forest would go up in flames. Fortunately, he knew enough not to put it out in the middle of the pine needles. In spite of everything, I enjoyed myself, listening to the horse’s hooves and the squeak of the leather saddle, rocking to the rhythm of Pal’s smooth gait. Someday, I’m going on the ideal trail ride. This is how it would be. My family and I would set out on our own horses for a three or four-day ride near Henderson or someplace with hardly any people. There wouldn’t be any smoking, silly trail guides, and no Jennifer. Just the family, the horses, and the wildlife. I think Will Rogers was right when he said there was nothing as good for the inside of a person as the outside of a horse."
9, "The Hill There is an old hill on my Grandma’s property. The hill is grown over with grass, dead stinging nettles, and skunk cabbage. There is an old rickety bridge that you have to jump off to get safely to the ground because blackberries block the way. After the bridge you have to walk through matted dead grass, then you get to an old cedar tree. You cut through the small trail around the cedar tree to get to the road-like flat slanty path to the field. You sneak through the long dead grass. Finally you reach the fence. Be careful not to let the big white dog see you looking at the horses. (He thinks he owns and is guard of the fence and all things on both sides of it.) For a better view, go to the funny shaped tree, it works as a good lookout, and it’s a safe place where the neighbor dogs can’t get you. (No matter how hard they jump.) From the tree you can see a lot — my Uncle’s horses (down the hill) the Kapowsin and the Shady Ridge creeks, the place where the creeks meet together, the trail (both of them), the two bridges, the neighbor’s houses, Mr. L’s cows, and all the other trees and fields. When you’re done looking around (and when the coast is clear of the big white dog) you can jump down and head for the one still usable trail that my mom made and used when she was little. I’m not sure how its possible that the trail is still there but I think the coyotes, deer, possum, skunk, rabbits, mice, and snakes use it, and keep it there. Be careful when you go down because if you’re behind someone pesky, pushed aside branches will slap you in the face. When you get to the waterside, sit down, listen tot he rushing, slurping, sound of water, the lapping against the sandy bank, the birds chirping, watch for animals. If you stay still and quiet the animals will relax and come out of hiding, and the birds will start chirping. Walk back to the big cedar tree and wander eastward, up the busy hill and you will find yourself in the cemetary. If you don’t want to go there, go west and take a swim in the icy water. (If you don’t freeze.) When you’re really cold, dry off. If you want, catch a couple of crawdads. Then, go home and fry your crawdads, and eat them, and think about your day on the hill."   
9, "Big Person’s Shoes  I remember walking through shopping centers while my mom looked for shoes. I always wished I would grow another inch or two so my feet could fit into the wonderful \"big person’s shoes.\" My mother would look over several kinds, then, after choosing her favorite, ask the clerk for the left shoe. I longed for the day when I could try them on, just like she did. Being able to wear shoes with heels represented a grown-up to me. I wanted to be an adult in the worst way. Sometimes after we had gone shopping, I would sneak into my mother’s bedroom. Then quietly, so no one would hear, I would slip the new shoes out of their box and onto my feet. What I used to think was a grand and ladylike gait, was really an unsteady wobble. I would saunter over to the full length mirror to admire my shoes — well, her shoes. Then I would twirl around and cast condescending glances at the closet, nightstand, lamp and other furniture. I would pretend these things were some of the other fourth graders in my class at school. One Saturday afternoon, I was destined to spend the day at a shoe store in town. Sitting in the back seat, I started to think about fancy shoes. Upon arriving, I discovered large signs that advertised a sale at the shoe store. Grudgingly I dragged in. After a few minutes, I noticed something. My mom, who wears a size 8½ was looking in the size 5½ section. Suddenly, I straightened up and looked at her again. Yes, she was there! I couldn’t believe it, maybe she was looking for shoes for me. \"Megan,\" said my mother \"Would you come over here for a moment?\" Immediately I leaped to my feet, and in a flash I was by my mother’s side. In her hand was a shoe, the most beautiful that I had ever seen. It was black patent leather with a dazzling red bow on the toe. \"Honey, would you try this on?\" she said. Immediately I said yes. The shoe fit perfectly. It was made for me. I looked pleadingly into her eyes for the sparkle that meant I could have them. Then she said, \"Clerk, would you please get the mate for me?\" I just couldn’t believe it! I was the luckiest girl in the whole fourth grade! When we got home, I tried on the shoes with my best dress. Then I went into the kitchen and twirled around so my father could see. I didn’t know what he would say. I stood and bit my lip waiting for the inevitable to come. To my surprise he said that I was turning into a pretty young lady! I will remember that moment forever. A year or so later I grew out of the shoes. I regretfully packed them in a box to give away. A girl who lived next door was to get my shoes. A few months later I was at a school carnival and saw the girl wearing my shoes. They were a size too big and they flopped around. Even so, I could see the glow on her face. She was wearing \"big person’s shoes.\" "
9, "This is Why I Write Thoughts pound in my head, day after day, until I get them down on paper. Each idea brings out a slice of what’s inside of me. That may mean hours of writing fiercely, while thoughts flip through my head and new ideas emerge. Other times it means crumbling up pages of crossouts, or retyping one page over and over until I’m satisfied with how it reads. Then there are times that are maddening; I can’t go forward or backward, instead I stare at a blank page for hours. Still I write. I can’t imagine how I could stop. Writing is power. I control my writing. It’s as stable as I am. No one can change it, except for me. I make all the decisions. Other people give me advice, but I’m the one who puts the words on the paper. As a writer, I am free. No one tells me what I can and can’t say. I have to decide what part of me should be written, how much of me I want to share. There are no rules or boundary lines to follow. Some things aren’t meant to be written, but the only way to learn what they are is by writing them. Writing isn’t all facts. The facts are what can be taught, but the rest comes only from the writer. Teachers can give us guidelines, advice, and encouragement that we’ll treasure, but the heart of a piece comes from us. Writing is more than following rules and advice; it requires that the writer follow her heart. Writing expands me. It stimulates my mind. When I write, I feel alive, I want to know everything. I’m always acquiring new skills. Soon after I started writing I needed more answers than I could get from my English book or from my parents. I started learning by studying how other people wrote, and then picked up on my own mistakes. I pored over every bit of information I could find. A lot of the time I improved subconsciously, absorbing new vocabulary and techniques from all around me. My writing is always changing. Sometimes I’m half way through a page, and I’ll just rewrite it completely. What I find interesting about writing is that I can see myself growing along with it. It makes me look at the world through different perspectives, and helps me understand myself. My writing gradually grows. I spend hours trying to capture the core of myself within the empty pages of my journal. Over time, my writing becomes more structured as I carefully choose every word that I use to make them fly right off the page into my readers’ minds. Writing is my companion. It’s what I do in my spare time. On rainy summer days, while my mother works, my father is outside, and my sister is at a friend’s house, I write. I pour out my deepest secrets, my strongest feelings. This is what I do. This is why I write." 
9, "The Sand Dollar In yesteryear, when Moby Dick was just a tadpole, and the seas rolled and thundered over the jetties and onto the shore, I searched for my first sand dollar still hidden somewhere in the ever stretching Naragansett Beach. I’d been going there since I was a toddler, not finding much more than sea weed and empty crab shells, which were picked clean by the screeching sea gulls, nature’s best garbage man. Now I was five, I could run and search on my own, no more holding hands with Mom and Dad. I could run with the big kids down the beach with the wind roaring in my ears like huge jet engines. I was in search of the still fashionable sand dollar, that naturally perfect disc with a dotted star on top and a hole in the center of its flat bottom. While in town the first evening of beachcombing, I spotted just the box I wanted for my collection of valuables. It was not just a box, but a red cedar chest approximately 4 by 8 inches and designed like a treasure chest. Mom and Dad thought it was just what I needed. I couldn’t wait for morning to come. I could hear the waves beckoning to me through the partially open window in my room. Like counting sheep, the waves took their toll. Clam digging started early before light, my parents went while the tide was still out. I looked for shells. I found all different kinds: broken crabs, empty clams because the sea gulls got to them first, but still no sand dollars. After lunch, Mom and Dad decided to help me find some sand dollars, but first, Dad said he had to stop at a store in town to get some things for dinner. He left me to go ahead and look for sand dollars with Mom. When Dad got back he helped me look, too. I was looking up and down, around rocks and in tide pools. Then I spotted it, partially sticking out of the sand; I found it, my first sand dollar! It was probably the only one on the beach for 50 miles. I put it in my treasure box. This shell still sits in my box along with years of awards, pins, buttons from athletics and scouting, and a Swiss army knife I found in the woods where I used to live. These things keep a warm link to my past. Naragansett Beach, I found out years later, doesn’t have sand dollars, but the local souvenir shop does, kept in reserve for moms and dads who want to help their children build a memory."   
9, "A Jog and a Dog Having already stretched and run a fourth of my distance, I arrived at my favorite spot and halted. It was the beginning of fall, the leaves of maple trees swirled down around me, crunching under my weight as I strode toward a gigantic tree trunk. Sitting, just taking in my surroundings, I noticed dusk turning to dark and decided to start home. As I moved to stand up, I saw something crouching across the road. I took a step back, it took a step forward. Fear hadn’t registered yet, but my curiosity had. Walking forward to get a closer look, I recognized Bear, a neighbor’s friendly black lab. Sighing, I reached to pet the dog, but stopped short as a low rumble in the animal’s throat grew to a loud growl. I quickly pulled my hand to safety and backed off. Staring at the dog, I shrugged my shoulders in bewilderment, turned, and walked away. The clicking of the dog’s claws on the pavement followed. Thinking nothing of it, I resumed my jogging, only to have the gigantic Labrador growling right at my heels again. Scared now, I broke into a run, and that’s when the dog bit me, hard into the flesh of my leg. I fell to the ground, screaming in agony. The owner of the dog came out, wondering what the noise was about. Yanking on the dog’s collar, the man struggled to pull the vicious animal off of me, which after several tries he managed to accomplish. While all this happened, another close neighbor who had witnessed the incident called 911. It was decided afterward that the dog had contracted rabies and he was soon put to sleep. I was given a series of shots and a few stitches only, and after a couple of years, my leg healed, but the scars remain on both the inside and out."   
9, "A Perfect \"Modern Classic\" For conservative Shakespeare lovers, the sound of a Romeo and Juliet updated for the 1990s is enough to evoke cries of blasphemy. Admittedly, the thought of the Bard’s timeless story of two young lovers being updated for an age group that doesn’t have the attention span to read a Dr. Pepper label, much less deal with iambic pentameter, is frightening. However, director Baz Luhrmann manages to pull off an adaptation of the classic that neither waters down the brilliance of Shakespeare nor bores the average modern day audience. By casting the young and talented Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio, and sticking with the Shakespearean verse, Luhrmann creates a perfect \"modern classic.\" The \"Two households, both alike in dignity\" reside in fair Verona Beach, which represents modern-day Los Angeles. The battle between the two families is made evident by weapon-toting thugs whose cars sport \"Montague\" or \"Capulet\" license plates. A billboard examined closely advertises L’amour, not Coca-Cola. Such seemingly hokey touches are not so; rather, they add to the realism of Shakespeare’s language in a present-day setting. After one makes the easy adjustment of mentally balancing lyrical verse with the dazzling eye-candy setting and fast-paced action, Romeo and Juliet is entirely captivating. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are not just drool-elicitors for both the sexes, but strong actors who have the ability to speak Shakepeare’s language and draw the viewers into the tragedy. Although spoken differently, the verse is just as striking as in the theater. The innuendo is obvious when DiCaprio whines about being left unsatisfied in the balcony scene; Danes’ crooning about \"my only love sprung from my only hate\" is breathtaking. Danes does not allow DiCaprio to steal the show as a Juliet would be apt to do; she too gives a striking performance as Romeo’s passionate yet innocent desire. John Leguizamo plays perfectly the troublesome villain, Tybalt, and Harold Perrineau as Mercutio is a hilarious addition. The beauty and tragedy of the play begin at his death, as do the emotional movie-goer’s tears. One can cry all the way to the end of the film, as the lovers share a coffin in a candle-lit cathedral. Danes’ realistic sob at the realization of her lover’s death causes a snicker from the average moviegoer, and the scene is altered a bit from its original form, but the emotion-packed climax is handled well. Not everyone will appreciate this new Romeo and Juliet, which, with its actors and its modern look, is clearly aimed at a younger audience. However, it is clear the film is more than bait for mall rats. The new version combines gripping action with the classic original verse to create a modern, open-minded Shakespeare-lover’s dream. And even if one is not inclined to iambic pentameter, its two-hours traffic is exciting enough to keep those who only have the patience to read the Cliff Notes version from squirming in their seats."

9, "Anticipating the Dream  \"And we are scatterlings of Africa On a journey to the stars Far below we leave forever Dreams of what we were.\" —Johnny Clegg I am sitting with my grandparents in the spectators’ section of the echoing auditorium, my baby brother on my lap. I’m not sure what I expected this morning, but thus far it has been an incredibly boring experience. The judge is half an hour late, and to add to that, Graeme, my brother, is tired and fussing, and would evidently much prefer his mother’s lap to mine. Unfortunately for him, my parents and older brother are sitting on the other side of the room with almost 200 others. Thirty-one countries are represented here today. This is a citizenship ceremony. My parents, my older brother, and I were all born in South Africa. After living in the United States for 13 years, they are finally becoming citizens. I am not yet 18; consequently, I have to wait for my parents to obtain citizenship before I am eligible. All my younger siblings were born here, and are therefore Americans by birth. Graeme was only momentarily distracted by the book we brought along to amuse him. He is now struggling noisily to climb off my lap. It’s time to bring out the secret weapon: candy. I just hope my supply doesn’t dwindle too quickly. In our particular situation, it seems rather odd that the citizenship process works this way. Having lived here since I was two, I have always been more American than anything else. I don’t speak Afrikaans, but my parents do (as well as English). I am the one who briefed my mother on American history and government before she took the citizenship test. Not only that, but I am always having to remind my parents that the word is flashlight, not torch, and that here in America we have a tooth fairy, not a mouse, who comes to fetch our teeth. After today, my parents will be Americans, and I will be the unique one, the alien, the only South African remaining in our house. How bureaucratic of the American government to work that way. The judge has arrived, and now that everyone has stopped talking, Graeme has started to cry. I make a hasty retreat up the slanted aisle to the back of the room. Maybe I can rock him to sleep. I have often asked my parents why we moved here from our homeland, and from what I’ve gathered, there are several reasons. Foremost is apartheid, the total segregation of South Africa, whereby whites held all power and blacks were not even allowed to vote. The government established separate buses, bathrooms, even public lawns. My parents, who are by no means radical, were very strongly against apartheid and were arrested for protesting. They were released in the next moment because they were white, while their black friends were hauled off to jail. The atmosphere was growing more volatile every day, and when the building across the street from where my mother worked was bombed, my parents decided that it was no longer safe to stay, especially with two small children. Consequently, my father took advantage of the first opportunity to get a job here in America. It must be incredibly difficult to live in a country that is so immoral, where people are looked down upon simply because their skin happens to be a different shade. How can you pledge allegiance to a government responsible for the obvious evil around you every day? America was segregated at one point also, but at least the government called it \"separate but equal.\" In South Africa, the government did not even attempt to bring about equality. Can anyone take pride in a government like that? Graeme is finally asleep, drooling on my shoulder, and I can return, victorious, to my seat. The judge has been giving a speech about the privileges and responsibilities that come with being an American citizen. I’m beginning to understand why my parents are so excited about this day. At first I expected nothing of great importance to occur in this ceremony. I imagined we would arrive here, say the Pledge of Allegiance, and my parents would receive a piece of paper declaring them \"American citizens.\" As it turns out, a lot more is involved than the mere title. Today my parents will not only become eligible to vote and serve on jury duty, but they will automatically become part of American history, culture, and society. The United States becomes their country, a land that kindles pride. All of a sudden, they have a duty to serve this country and to be loyal to it above all others. It is a colossal decision for them to make. South Africa is a beautiful nation. My parents grew up there and have many fond recollections. They remember visiting game preserves and finding lions in the middle of the road. They remember going to school with their friends and tormenting substitute teachers. The different snacks they ate—biltong, Chappie gum, and Bovril—could never be found in the United States. My parents remember getting married in the city of Florida on February 2, 1980. I’m certain it must have been difficult to leave everything, including family, and move to America. Now, at this ceremony, everything is becoming finalized. They will no longer be a part of South Africa, but South Africa will always be a part of them. They have given up the past in anticipation of the future, one filled with hope for greater peace, prosperity, and happiness: the American Dream.I scan the room, the many different faces of my fellow spectators: grandparents, parents, and children of various races. Anyone can read the pride in their eyes as they watch their loved ones from across the room. I snap to attention. People are rising. This is the moment; they are about to take the oath. Now I have grown just as excited as my parents seemed to be this morning. My mother’s smile tells me she is enjoying herself. Right hands raised, the would-be citizens repeat after the judge the words that will change their lives forever. Piles of paperwork and months of waiting are now fulfilled in a few simple words. As the final echoes of the judge’s words die out, I hardly hear his congratulations. One fact only is the focus of my thoughts: my parents and another brother are Americans. All my older brothers and my sister are Americans. Soon it will be my turn, and I can hardly wait."
9, "Huddling Together  \"Let’s kill ’em!\" Bob exclaims as we walk toward the stadium. \"I’d love to see Zach Thomas crush Thurman Thomas,\" I reply. We are not brutal people; we are simply expressing our need to win at all costs. The Miami Dolphins are playing the Buffalo Bills, their most hated opponent. We had this game circled on the calendar since training camp began. The thermometer on this Monday night reads a cool 68 degrees, but the atmosphere in the stadium burns like desert heat. \"It doesn’t get better than this,\" Bob says as we occupy our seats just a few rows up from the end zone.  \"I wouldn’t trade this for anything else,\" I reply. \"You, me, the fans, the noise, the action: what more could I want?\" The countdown to the opening kickoff nears five minutes. The crowd files in while the players run onto the field through the giant inflated Dolphins helmet. Everyone stands united during the singing of the national anthem. The Bills win the coin toss, and they choose to receive the opening kickoff. \"That’s the only thing you guys are gonna win tonight!\" I jest. Bob has lived with my mother and me for five years, and he will marry my mother this coming March. Fortunately, I never experienced the crisis of anguish and rebellion that many children suffer in divorces and remarriages. From the beginning, I felt comfortable around him. He never attempted to dominate the household or me. Naturally, though, we did not immediately feel a bond as strong as the one I share with my parents. Football sparked the beautiful friendship we have. Football never interested me earlier in my life. I thought of it as a pointless sport in which a bunch of fat men jumped on top of each other. I rolled my eyes the first time Bob spoke about football. I figured I would have to put up with this nonsense until I left for college. \"Lovely,\" I thought. \"Just lovely.\"  I reluctantly allowed Bob to teach me the workings of the game. As he helped me analyze the game, I started distinguishing linebackers from running backs in a \"dogpile.\" We picked apart defenses as a quarterback would, and I called penalties before the referees did. The underlying organization of the game revealed itself to me, and its logic suited my predominantly left-brained mind perfectly. More importantly, though, football fostered a common bonding ground for us. \"Touchdown, your Miami Dolphins!\" the announcer proclaims. Sixty-five thousand aqua-clad Dolphin fans stand cheering in the aisles; thirteen thousand blue-clothed, blue-faced Bills fans slouch dejectedly in their seats. Bob and I carry out our own touchdown ritual: we alternate high fives between our left and right hands six times: one for each point scored. Olindo Mare kicks the ball through the goalposts as if aiming at us, and we exchange another high five for the extra point. The Dolphins jingle echoes off the walls of the stadium while the residual smoke of fireworks blankets the stadium. \"They just can’t beat our defense,\" Bob says in awe. The Dolphins take a quick 10-0 lead, and our devastating defense destroys the determination of the Bills when they threaten to score. The Bills offense drives down to the three-yard line after the Dolphin defense commits a pass-interference penalty. They attempt two runs and a pass; all three fail. On fourth down, they must kick a field goal, but they fail to convert the kick to a score because a linebacker blocks the kick. Bob and I howl like wolves and bump chests. We savor the goal-line stand as we laugh at the Buffalo fans seated two rows in front of us. After just half a season, football established itself as an institution in my household. Every Sunday, I found myself glued to the television screen for nine hours soaking up football. Consequently, I spent a good amount of time with Bob on our reclining couch, by far the best place for guys to talk. Most of the talking involved football, but beer and car commercials supplied key opportunities for other topics to slip into conversation, such as my schoolwork, my progress in karate, his job, and his latest scuba dives. Deeper subjects such as marriage, my relationship with my father, and our feelings about my mother came up as well. Football provided us with the perfect excuse to get to know each other. \"And that’s the end of the half with your Miami Dolphins leading the Buffalo Bills twenty to ten.\" We leaned back in our seats and put football aside for a while. \"So when are you taking the SAT?\" Bob asks. \"I’m taking it in April. It doesn’t count, though, you know. I just want to see how good my verbal is so that I know what improvements I have to make.\"  \"So, do you have any girl interests right now?\"  \"No, not really. There was this one girl I liked a few weeks ago, but she’s too fake for me. How’s work going?\" \"It’s all right. Some of the tech stocks took big hits this week, but the pharmaceuticals went up nicely. When are you going to Minnesota to visit your dad?\"  \"Not this coming weekend, but the next one. It’s starting to get pretty cold up there.\" We continue talking until the game resumes. Miami scores a quick touchdown to secure its lead. The offense drives on cruise control, and the defense stands its ground. Time winds down, and the Dolphins win by a score of 30-13. The victory song (\"Na-na, na, nah; Na-na, na, nah; Hey, hey-ey, good-bye\") plays over the speakers. Players run to the locker room raising their helmets high above their heads; fans stream into the parking lot, shouting cheers of supremacy. \"That was awesome.\" My words dribble hoarsely after yelling for hours. \"We couldn’t have played a better game.\" \"You got that right. Marino got us 30 points tonight, we only allowed one touchdown, and Mare was perfect on his kicking. It’s always great to leave the stadium like this.\" \"Especially after Monday-nighters. The last thing I’d want is to lose, sulk on the way home, and then get only three hours of sleep because I’ve got school the next day. Phew, I’m so tired. The intensity just wears me out.\" \"I had a great time, Dave. It’s always fun watching with you. You get so into it. You’re a nut!\" Through our mutual enjoyment of football, I have acquired a more son-like warmth toward Bob. That change reflects Bob’s transition from visiting us to living with us. I do not say, \"Hey, Bob, how’s it going?\" anymore; instead, I greet him with \"Good morning, Bob. What are you doing today?\" I am the son he never had, and he fills in some of the holes that my father left when he moved to Minnesota. Amazingly enough, it all started with a brown pigskin ball. The beauty of football lies in its power to unite crowds. The beauty of love lies in its power to unite individuals."
9, "H’s Hickory Chips  I look at the old tin building; it seems to have been there since the beginning of time. Its strong posts and nonchalant slouch make me wonder if it will be rooted in the same place forever. As soon as I walk in, the strong, rustic smell of hickory wood assails me. It takes me back to my family’s last Fourth of July barbecue, when the hickory chips smoking the ribs gave off their thick aroma. I wait for my eyes to adjust in the dark, humid place, not taking a step until they do because of the ageless spider that could have made its home in my path. My tongue already asks for a drink of water as I breathe the musty air littered with sawdust. Spraying on sticky repellent, I wonder if the thirsty mosquitoes will stay away. I walk to my work area, making sure I do not trip over the precious finds and the hopeful antiques. I brush against a wall of the old building that is really more of a shed, and a mat of spiderwebs clings to my shirt and refuses to come off. The gentle hum of the small fans and the roar of the monster ones fight against the humid air. I pull out a machine that is supposed to tie the two-pound bags that are full of hickory chips, but it has a mind of its own. Placing the bulky machine on the high bench with its layers of gritty sawdust, I hope it has decided to work today and load a bag into it. As I pull down the top of the machine, I stare it in its mechanical eyes, willing it to work. I pull the bag back out of the machine and look down on another battle lost. For now the brute has won the war of wills, and I prepare myself with a box of red ties to close all 1,000 of the smooth bags by hand. The clang of the shovel dumping its first load onto the ancient scale can be heard throughout the shed, signaling that work has begun. The salty sweat begins to bead on my forehead, and for the first of many times, I wipe it away, leaving a smudge of dirt and dust. Already I yell \"First shower!\" to assure my place in line after our work is completed. I hear my three sisters shout numbers throughout the shed. Amanda, the last to call a number, frowns, knowing she will have to wait a long time for the hot water to return after all the showers. My grandfather walks into the shed, a cane in one hand and a pack of icy cold colas in the other. His deep Southern drawl permeates the building as he asks if we’ve had lunch yet. Our eyes brighten and smiles play on our faces as we silently hope he will offer the traditional sloppy whopper and golden fries. He leaves as silently as he came in, and our stomachs start to growl with anticipation for lunch. My sisters’ and aunt’s chatting and soft laughter has started as they begin to catch up on each other’s lives. I look around, wondering what people would say if they could see the Horne sisters outside of the house with no makeup on and their hair in disarray. I laugh and keep the thoughts to myself, listening in as my aunt’s next story begins. At the end of the day, when all of the work is done, I pull the pallet—our makeshift gate—closed and pet my grandfather’s latest endeavor at a vicious watchdog. I sigh with relief that it’s over. Even though sometimes I dread the thought of work, especially when I know it is going to occupy another Saturday, the time spent with my family and the laughter shared will always be worth the sweat and scrapes. The memories will always be treasures in my mind and will continue to be among the things I laugh about and love the most."
9, "It’s a Boy!  \"Congratulations, you have a new baby boy!\" my child-development teacher said as she handed over the 10-pound bundle. Last year in my high school child-development class, each student had to take the \"Think-It-Over\" baby home for a night to get a taste of parenthood. Even before I received the baby, I knew I was not ready to be a parent as a senior in high school. I could still remember when my brother and sister were little and I would have to take care of them all the time. At least the doll had no dirty diapers I would have to change. It was a Friday night when my turn came to take the 10-pound plastic doll home. The doll really did look like a live baby from a distance. It even had a pleasant baby powder smell. After I took the baby home in his car seat, I changed him into some really cute clothes because my friends and I were going out that night. I then decided to name him Tyler. Inside the body of this doll was a computer that was programmed to make periodic crying sounds. I was the only person who could stop the crying because I had the key. This key, tied to my wrist, could be inserted in the doll’s back to stop the crying. So far, so good. The doll had not cried, yet. My friends came over, and we all piled into the car. It was kind of squished because we had the baby’s seat in there, too. I had to treat the doll like a real baby because the computer inside also measured any abuse to the doll, such as shaking or neglect. The hour-long drive to the restaurant was uneventful. It was rather chilly, so I decided to wrap Tyler in a blanket and carry him in that way. I also had a diaper bag with diapers, a bottle, and an extra set of clothes hanging on my arm. Because it was Friday night, there were a lot of people waiting in line to get a table. When I walked into that crowded entryway, I got some very weird looks and quite a few raised eyebrows. My friends also noticed the glares and stares, so we decided to make a game out of the whole situation. I stood in the corner pretending to rock Tyler to sleep. Every once in a while my friends would peek in the blanket and say, \"Oh, how cute.\" I could not help but laugh. And although it was funny to my friends and me, some of the people did not think it was so funny that I had a baby. I overheard one couple say, \"Why would she bring a baby here?\" These people were giving me rude looks and forming judgments about me because they thought I was a teenage mom. Others just smiled at me sympathetically and felt sorry for me because I was only a child with a child.  We finally got a table, and the waiter, not knowing I was carrying a doll, asked me if I needed a high chair. I told him it was just a doll, but a high chair would be good. He thought it was funny that I actually dared to bring a doll into the restaurant, so he brought a high chair, plus a red balloon for the little one. Again, during our meal, my friends and I received strange looks from the others in the restaurant. One couple kept walking by our table just to get a look at my baby. I think they were trying to figure out if the doll was an actual baby. As the couple walked by, my friends and I started discussing how people so quickly judged me and assumed that I was the mother of the baby. We decided that we would probably do the same if we saw a teenage girl coming in with a child and a group of friends. Teenage pregnancy is not accepted where I live and is definitely not the norm; many girls would hide their pregnancies if they decided to keep their babies. We went to the mall after we were finished eating, and I had to take Tyler with me. My friends were looking at clothes, but I couldn’t because I was carrying this \"baby\" (which was becoming quite heavy). So I just roamed around wishing I could try on clothes, too. Then the baby started to cry this horrible imitation baby’s cry. It was so loud and terrible. I quickly put the key into the doll’s back so it would quit crying, and then I had to explain to the salesclerk why I was carrying around a plastic doll. I was so glad to finally go home. I learned a lot through my experience with the \"Think-It-Over\" baby. The doll definitely reinforced my thinking that I was not ready to be a parent, but it also made me more aware of the larger picture. It opened my eyes to the judgments people make about others. People do not realize that some things are not the way they seem. The doll seemed like it was my baby, but that was not the case. I was only carrying it around for a class project. The people in the restaurant were so quick to judge me because they assumed I was a teenage mom. They undoubtedly thought I was stupid for taking a baby to a noisy, smoky place; they didn’t realize it was just a plastic doll underneath that blanket. I sometimes catch myself judging people I do not know, just because of the first impression they give. In reality, I do not have a clue about their real stories. I especially think people judge teenage girls with babies too quickly. Sure, they may have made a mistake, but the girls usually know that, and they are the ones who have to pay the price. I only experienced the glares and rude comments for one night, but I thought of all the girls who have to deal with these looks wherever they go. We should all be slower to judge these girls, or anyone else, and realize that some things are not as they seem."
9, "My Greatest Instrument  Some people express themselves through beautiful art; others are masters of the page and speak silently through writing. I, on the other hand, express myself with the greatest instrument I have, my voice. I make my living by speaking to groups large and small. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than public speaking, and my interest in public speaking began when I was quite young. At age eight I realized that I belonged in front of an audience. I started giving demonstrations and speeches in local county 4-H competitions until I was eligible to participate in state competitions. I won every state competition that I entered. Soon other public speaking opportunities arose; I represented an artist named Ann Cross at the Art Walk in Keene and was an active participant on the debate team and the captain in eighth grade. During March of eighth grade, I had the best opportunity yet to practice my oratorical skills: I was selected, out of all the students entered in New Hampshire, to write and read a four-minute speech on national television. My job was to introduce Elizabeth Dole, who at the time was interested in running for president. I was notified the day before the event and so had only one night to write and memorize my speech. When I arrived the next morning in Bedford, New Hampshire, I was greeted by photographers, camera crews, and newspaper reporters! Then I was escorted backstage to meet Elizabeth Dole. After speaking briefly with her and having her review my speech, we marched through a crowd of flashing bulbs to our places on the stage. Soon it was time for my speech. I was introduced, and as I walked to the podium, I couldn’t help but smile at the audience. I had a feeling of complete exhilaration flowing through my veins. When I finished, I received a standing ovation, and Mrs. Dole surprised me by giving me a great hug and thanking me for my comments on the importance of education. But even after she finished speaking, the excitement was far from over. I was with her for all her photographs, and I was interviewed for a few moments by WMUR and later by the Keene Sentinel. After the media finished with us, I met various supporters of Mrs. Dole’s. They were all happy to meet me and flooded me with questions and praise. I truly felt on top of the world. After that, I participated in various competitions and events. My favorite by far was Young Chataqua, a wonderful summer program. In Chataqua I portrayed the life of Margaret Bourke-White, a pioneer photographer, in a 12-minute monologue that took a month to research, prepare, and memorize. It was an amazing experience. Although the other students and I were only expected to perform our monologues once, two other organizations asked me to speak. After Chataqua, I participated in my first play, Everybody’s Crazy, and I organized a debate team at my high school. I continued my 4-H activities, did volunteer work, went to Chataqua each year, and participated in the American Legion’s Oratorical Contest. Those powerful first experiences transformed my life and gave me a career that I love. As I look back on a life shaped by public speaking, I feel a great debt of gratitude to that eight-year-old girl who first got up in front of crowds at the county fair. She helped me become the person I am today."
9, "Snapshots  Most of the snapshots of my life are held in the photo albums of my mind. Some were captured by a camera, and those pictures I keep in a shoebox under my bed. I’m lucky to have \"shoebox photos\" of the earliest things I can remember. For example, three days after my third birthday, Katherine Emily arrived. I remember my dad taking me to see my new baby sister; we stopped at a gas station on the way to the hospital and bought my mom candy and a cola. That day, the camera caught the tiny smile only a big sister could have as she holds one of the best birthday presents ever. I don’t take up even half of a blue hospital chair as I cradle Katie in my arms. She is wrapped all in white, like the little angel that every baby is. My white, hooded sweatshirt has faint patches of sky blue, and just a tiny crimson triangle of a T-shirt peeks out from behind the zipper. Looking closer, a third person can be seen: my mother’s wrist-banded hand holds Katie’s head up. My tiny arms weren’t quite strong enough for that task. That was the first time I ever posed with Katie. Looking at that photo makes me remember all the other pictures I have of Katie and me, even when there was no camera with film and batteries ready to go. It’s these pictures that I’ll never lose. Before Katie and I went off to school, we spent our days in the tunnels and caves of cardboard boxes and secret hideaways under the kitchen table. Our house has never been short on toys (there were six kids born before Katie and me), but boxes have always been a favorite. I remember being able to easily slide through the long passageways, my back not even brushing against the \"ceilings\" of our tunnels and forts. Katie had an even easier time but often needed a flashlight in the darkness. Our cities of cardboard were draped in rainbows of blankets and quilts. On the insides, however, the less light we had, the better. It’s too bad my memory camera has no flash. \"Picture Sales\" were the basis for the kids’ economy in our house. Competition was fierce in our system of capitalism. Jake is three years older than I am, and I’m three years older than Katie, but we all tried to outdo each other drawing pictures, attractively placing them around our bedrooms, and bringing in the customers. Prices ranged from 1 to 25 cents, and we loved counting the money at the end of the night. Katie and I often combined our assets and tried to steal Jake’s business. Our walls were lined with neat rows of crayon drawings. We stocked anything from flowers to people, but supportive parents and older siblings made purchases from all of us. Katie and I loved having our big sister Megan take us for summer walks. She was in high school, and hanging out with her added \"coolness\" to our status at Winkler Elementary. Filled with excess energy on the way to the park, beach, or the Hunny Tree gas station for pop and candy, we always loved to run ahead. Megan would let us, usually to the next telephone pole or two, where we would have to stop and wait for her. Shorter legs made the telephone pole seem distant, growing slowly closer as the Queen Anne’s lace flew past in the ditch. I can recall countless times that Katie and I woke up late and found ourselves running down the road to catch the bus. Looking back, this has to be one of the more ironic rolls of my \"memory film,\" because I ended up running cross-country; Katie wound up in poms and football. Of my six sisters, Katie is the closest to me in age, and she’s often been my closest companion during family events. We are usually the only teenage kids around at family gatherings and on shopping trips in the family van. This explains why Katie and I are expert mimes. The shopping trips provide hours of being stuffed in the van with our younger siblings, Scarlet and Michael; the visits to Minnesota to see relatives yield seven hours of driving each way. On one occasion, Katie and I boarded the van, choosing the back seat. After 10 minutes of being annoyed by everyone else, we formed an invisible wall between the two front seats and ourselves. We mimed a smooth, perfectly flat, soundproof surface to perfection. The last picture on that roll of memories was Mom telling us to stop it. The Niagara Falls/Canada/New York trip last year was the closest Katie and I have been. The same week of our shared 16th and 13th birthday-bonfire party, we spent days cramped in the back of my sister Sara’s car, next to her one-year-old daughter, Hannah. Our quiet brother-in-law Brad was driving, and Hannah cried the whole way. That trip provided enough scenes to make a full-length movie, but I have only one shoebox picture of Katie and me in front of Niagara Falls. We are both bundled up like we were in the picture taken 13 years earlier. This time, though, we wear dark blue jeans and gray sweatshirts, our matching brown hair pulled back, hers in a ponytail and mine behind a pale pink bandana. The background doesn’t take us to a quiet hospital room, but to the continuous rumble of beautiful Niagara Falls. On the left, the American Falls turn over beneath a rainbow of October foliage. Farther away, on the right, Horseshoe Falls bubbles under a mist that slowly rises above the horizon. Katie and I lean against the heavy, black railing, and against each other. Our smiles are sweet and happy, reminiscent of Katie’s first birthday. These two shoebox pictures of Katie and me are just two snapshots in a shared photo album, filled with every cake, thought, joke, and sweater we’ve shared. In the midst of looking through the collection, Katie yells at me, \"Hey, that’s my shirt!\" \"You borrow my stuff,\" I reply. \"Not without asking.\" \"You had my black skirt for three months.\" \"I asked for it.\" I let the fight peter out, not wishing to waste a memory on an argument about clothes. There will be plenty of hair-pulling, name-calling, and angry situations between Katie and me to come. I want to save my film for better times."
9, "Take Me to Casablanca  My day in Africa was one I’ll not soon forget. I toured two major cities of Morocco—land of mystery, enticement, and enchantment. I was expecting belly dancers, snake charmers, and many exotic sights filled with color and intricate decoration. While I did see some of what I expected, the majority of what I saw was totally unexpected and will haunt me forever. As I boarded the ship that was to take me across the Mediterranean Sea to the northern shores of Morocco, I felt an array of mixed emotions. Mainly, I was excited. After all, I was only 13 and about to become \"tricontinental.\" The previous five days I had spent in sunny Spain, and now I was to travel to Africa for one day. Besides excited, I also felt deeply intrigued and mystified. Moroccans practice the Muslim religion, and Arabic is one of their main languages. This may seem a bit prejudiced, but as I took my seat in the boat, the song \"Arabian Nights\" was playing over and over in my mind. However, I was dressed very conservatively so as not to offend anybody. The boat ride took only about 45 minutes. After we had docked and debarked the ship, we were led straight to a bus. My first glimpse of Africa wasn’t too exciting, since it was just pretty much like Andalucia, the southern region of Spain. It was a little warmer here, though, being so close to the equator. We rode for a while and then stopped to have our passports checked in a city owned by Spain. This is when I had my first \"real\" glimpse of Morocco. There was trash strewn all over alongside the old, cracked pavement of the road. Natives attending to their business stopped for a moment to stare at the tour bus that held so many foreigners. Of course, they could scarcely see us because of the tinted tour bus windows, but their dark eyes seemed to pierce straight through me. It was at this point that the Moroccan tour guide joined us. He was very short and wore a long white robe. A small maroon hat adorned his head. He spoke to us in a heavy accent that sounded sort of Spanish, warning us not to talk to any Moroccans on the streets because they would try to steal from us. He also warned us not to buy anything from the peddlers on the street, for the same reasons. He told us that the people would flock around us, harassing and trying to take advantage of us. I didn’t particularly pay attention, however, because I had heard these speeches when we were warned about the gypsies in Spain, and the gypsies had caused little trouble. I assumed the Moroccans would be the same. After the guide gave his speech, we drove to Tétouan, one of the major cities of Morocco. I can remember thinking we’d never make it there because the narrow dirt road was built a mere two or three feet from a sheer drop-off. When we finally reached Tétouan about an hour later, I looked excitedly out of my window, hoping to see a city in better condition than that of the Spanish town we had just left. But what I saw shocked me. Huge crowds of people stopped everything they were doing to stare at us. Most of them wore dirty, tattered clothing and were startlingly thin. I couldn’t help but stare, despite all our tour guide’s warnings. My mom gave me a gentle nudge. I hugged my camera closer to my body and stepped off the bus. Almost immediately, the native Moroccans began to step closer to our tour group. Their staring eyes burned straight into my mind. I felt like such an intruder because of the way they stared. My first feeling of guilt came when a woman holding a crying baby accidentally brushed up against me. I somehow managed to apologize, not wanting to offend her in any way. She just looked at me with sad, troubled eyes that seemed to say, \"How could you? How could you allow us to live this terrible life in a third-world country?\" I instantly felt gratitude for everything I had ever taken for granted. We were led through the narrow back streets of the main section of town. There were high, white walls of buildings on either side of us. These walls had open doorways that were the entryways to small rooms, which were homes. People appeared in these doorways and stared at us as if we were gods. Emaciated children in dirty scraps of clothing played in the trash and filth in the alleyways. They gazed up at us and smiled. I always smiled back, while I wondered if they knew there were better ways of life in other parts of the world, or whether they learned that as they became older. Our Moroccan guide led us through small, filthy alleyways that had a distinctive odor that someone said was marijuana. Perhaps these people felt that drugs were their only way of escaping terrible lives. We were led past a small opening in the walls. We could hear the screaming and crying of a small boy, about three or four years old. His right leg, from the knee down, was gushing blood. My stomach rolled over, and I wished desperately that there were something I could do to help him. A woman wrapped gauze around the wound, but the blood soaked straight through. I felt so rude just walking right past. A little while later, we were led into a quaint little restaurant. I didn't eat much; walking past all those sights had taken away my appetite. But I will never forget the bathroom in that restaurant. When I paid the woman attendant 100 pesetas (about 70 cents), she led me into a stall. After I had finished, the woman flushed by hand. She then poured some bottled water on my hands and squirted on soap. After I lathered, she rinsed my hands with more bottled water and pointed to the door, signaling that I was to leave. When everyone had finished eating and had used the bathroom, we got back on the bus for another hour’s drive to Tangiers. I honestly didn’t think I could take any more. When we reached Tangiers, the peddlers on the street flocked around us. I told all of them, politely but somewhat guiltily, \"No, thank you.\" We went straight to an indoor bazaar. There we could bargain all we wanted, but I didn’t really want anything. I felt badly giving money to big businesses that didn’t need it as much as the people on the streets did. The rest of the time in Tangiers was basically like our time in Tétouan, except that there were a great many more peddlers. After we came out of one shop, a man approached me with Moroccan hats called fezzes, which he sold for 2000 pesetas, or about 10 dollars. I said, \"No, thank you.\" The man replied, \"Oh, you buy from in store but don’t buy from the street, eh?\" I honestly didn’t know what to say, so I just said, \"I’m sorry.\" His reply was, \"I bet.\" I just kept on walking, feeling very guilty. But as it turned out, he gave my mom a 1000 peseta discount, so she bought three of the hats. As I boarded the bus, I felt relieved to be leaving Morocco behind me. But then I looked back at all the people, some of them children, and thought how difficult it must be to have to go through hardships every single day, hardships worse than anything we modern Americans have ever endured. I was leaving Morocco, but these people had no way out. Even today, the sights and sounds of its cities still haunt me. I suppose those memories always will."
9, "The Boy with Chris Pine Blue Eyes High school alone is the hardest part of any teenager’s life, but when it gets mixed in with an awkward adolescent’s idea of liking someone, life turns into a whirlwind emotional adventure. Like my plate wasn’t overflowing already with a chemistry teacher who called me Crash (a name I acquired after dropping a beaker during our first lab), a sassy algebra teacher who said that I didn't have the aptitude for the subject, or a French teacher who flirted with the class and laughed at her own jokes. No, I complicated things even further because, stupid me, I fell in love. It all started one morning at my locker as I fumbled to find the French book I hadn’t used in about a month. In the crowded locker bay someone stepped on my toes and, consequently, rammed me into the absolute zenith of high school popularity standing to my right. I accidentally hit Miss Popularity while she attempted to apply lipstick. In the reflection of the three mirrors that hung in her locker, I saw a red smear across her acne-free, rouged cheek. I also saw the image of the person responsible for this collision. When I turned to get a better glimpse, there he was. Lockers may have slammed, Miss Popularity may have pouted, but everything stopped for me. All I saw was him. It felt like someone had reached down my throat and, with strong fingers, drawn my breath and stomach from my trembling body. His sapphire eyes drilled deep into my heart, and every nuance of his face became eternally etched into my mind. The tall, thin body stood out like a glistening jewel among the dull coal of the locker bay. Sensing my eyes burning deep into him, he turned around and said, \"Ah, sorry. My bad.\" The words were spoken by a voice that could talk a man down from a ledge. I could tell by the tone and inflection that he felt deep remorse in his soul for displacing my body—or maybe the burrito he had at lunch didn’t agree with him, I’m not really sure. From that moment on, during every free second, I suddenly became busy thinking about him. Wondering about this boy made sleepless nights overflow with sweet images. Dull math periods were filled with idle daydreams. I became obsessed with this senior with Chris Pine blue eyes. I wasn’t the only one who decided that having Blue Eyes as a boyfriend was a good idea. Miss Popularity decided that he, out of all the salivating dogs begging, whimpering, pawing for her attention, would be the perfect playful puppy. Worse yet, I had to witness her primitive flirting ritual in the lunchroom. She would strut toward the soda machine, swaying her hips from side to side, in an effort to catch one of his incandescent blue eyes. She was beautiful and she knew it. This was when it really started to get good—for him I mean. Purposely, her skirt inched up revealing her fleshy thigh as she struggled to remove a quarter nestled in her warm pocket. Blue Eyes was rabid with lust. Foam gushed out of his mouth and fire burned within his eyes. He was imagining the heat of the metal, so close to her body, then falling from her manicured hand to the floor. As he picked the coin up, those blue eyes examined every centimeter of her shapely legs. He was so close he could smell the sweetness of her perfume mixed with laundry detergent and the playful scent of teenage girl. The whole scene caused a churning in my stomach, which turned to a hopeless nausea. The colorful world of love turned into a black, grey pit. Every strand of my hair hung like a 400-pound weight. There was no way I was going to give in to Miss Popularity, who just happened to be my best friend. Yes, yes, I was the goofy sidekick. She could turn the world on with her smile, and I couldn’t turn the world on with anything. Through friends, acquaintances, and the grueling detailed accounts from Miss Popularity, I slowly gained more knowledge about my new love. \"Oh, Lisa, he smells so good!\" Smile. Yeah, Miss Popularity, I bet anything with a pulse smells good to you. \"And he’s so sweet!\" Bigger smile. Oh, and why is he so sweet? Maybe it’s that shapely body of yours. \"But I might have to work on his style a bit. Then he’ll be really hot!\" Smile. Nod. Then he’ll be hot!? If the kid got any hotter he'd be illegal in 37 states and 2 territories! This boy should not be allowed to roam around in public. All the basics—name, address, and hobbies—slowly unfolded, and an elaborate plan of action for an encounter started to form in my mind. But before it had a chance to fully develop, I had a surprise Blue Eyes sighting. He came to my photography class during one of his study halls (by this time I knew his schedule) to do extra work on one of his pictures. My mind raced; my hands shook. Should I act like I like him? Should I not notice him? Should I talk to him? Talk to him. He’s your best friend’s boyfriend. Talk to him! Oh, how can I look at his cherubic face when I know he'll be looking back at mine? I don’t believe it. He’s got to be kidding. I don’t believe he’s wearing that shirt. He looks so good in that shirt. How can I talk to someone who looks that good in a shirt? That cotton clings to just the right places, and his jeans are sculpted to enhance and accentuate that squeezably soft… So distracted by the mental roller coaster I was on, I couldn’t speak when he said, \"Phat print.\" Left with my eyes agog, I missed my one opportunity to speak with that walking, talking piece of artwork. Days dragged on and so did Miss Popularity’s relationship with Blue Eyes. He would nip at her heels as they walked down the hall. They would cuddle in class, and she would even feed him at lunch! Whatever the phoniest couple thing that you’ve seen, they did it. I’m surprised that people weren’t driven to violent nausea and fits of puking when they saw them together. But like most good things, their relationship had to come to an unfortunate end. After Blue Eyes wasn’t such a new puppy for Miss Popularity, their relationship deteriorated. From what I gathered after late night confessionals with Miss Popularity, he wasn’t learning any new tricks. Later that year I went to his graduation, and with the toss of his cap and the flip of his tassel, a sense of defeat and despair filled my body. Good-bye. Jesus Mary Joseph, you are such an idiot. You obsessed over him for almost a year! Do you realize you never spoke one word to him? Not a single syllable. Yes, but if you had he would have laughed at you and your silly, girlish crush. You didn’t deserve him in the first place. Oh, but I really liked him. I liked him so much, and he didn’t even know I was alive! Get over it. Half the school doesn’t even know you’re alive. I watched his blue Honda Civic race away. With the peel of the tires and the smell of burning rubber, I knew he had gone forever. Then the pain lifted from my body, like a heavy weight, and was replaced by a feeling of accomplishment and relief. I made it through the grueling torture of a high school crush and lived to tell about it. There existed no class project hard enough or cafeteria food indigestible enough to even compare."
9, "The Climb I have this fear. It causes my legs to shake. I break out in a cold sweat. I start jabbering to anyone who is nearby. As thoughts of certain death run through my mind, the world appears a precious, treasured place. I imagine my own funeral, then shrink back at the implications of where my thoughts are taking me. My stomach feels strange. My palms are clammy. I am terrified of heights. Of course, it’s not really a fear of being in a high place. Rather, it is the view of a long way to fall, of rocks far below me and no firm wall between me and the edge. My sense of security is screamingly absent. There are no guardrails, flimsy though I picture them, or other safety devices. I can rely only on my own surefootedness—or lack thereof. Despite my fear, two summers ago I somehow found myself climbing to a high place, while quaking inside and out. Most of our high school had come along on a day trip to the Boquerón, a gorgeous, lush spot in the foothills of Peru. Its prime attraction is the main waterfall, about 100 feet high, that thunders into a crystal clear pool feeding the Aguaytia River. All around the pool and on down to the rushing river are boulders large and small. The beach is strewn with rocks. On both sides of the fall, the jungle stretches to meet it, rising parallel to it on a gentler slope. After eating our sack lunches within sight and sound of the fall, many of us wanted to make the climb to an area above it. We knew others had done so on previous trips. A few guys went first to make sure they were on the right path. But after they left, my group of seven decided to go ahead without waiting for them to return. I suspected we were going the wrong way, but I kept silent, figuring that the others knew better. We went along the base of the hill until we reached the climb. It stopped me in my tracks. The climb ascended steeply above us. Along the right edge, the jungle hugged the rocks; passage through its trees did not look feasible. The majority of my view was filled with rocks. Looming high to the sky, the boulders rose in a tiered manner. Peering back down toward the river, I saw a steep slope of rocks all the way to the water. All I could think about was how far it would be to fall. My tense thoughts were interrupted by the realization that my friends were already beginning to climb! My anxiety increased as I watched them. Do I turn back? My whole being shouted, \"Yes!\" Will I regret it later? I really want to get to the top, but… I voiced my uncertainties to my friends. They dismissed my fears and encouraged me to stick it out. Questioning my own sanity, I decided at least to attempt the climb. I chose a path that seemed easiest. My friend Tom was ahead of me. Then, suddenly, he slipped and slid backward about 10 feet! I watched, paralyzed, until he stopped himself and assured us he was all right. My heart was hammering. Now those who had tried the other way came back; it had not worked. Consoling myself that my friend Seth would be right behind me, I shakily began the ascent. The \"path\" led up a narrow area between boulders. In it, we reached a place where there just were no good handholds. Seth braced my foot, and those above sent down words of encouragement. I was soon past the first challenge safely, but not feeling much better about the rest of the climb. The difficulties only increased from that point on, with scary spot after scary spot. Though I knew I should not look down, I could not always ignore the long drop to the boulders below. My breathing sped up, but my heart pounded even faster, growing loud in my ears. My friends kept right on climbing. But they did not forget me. Someone was always behind me to help hold my feet steady when necessary, and someone else was always ahead to offer a hand up. I trusted them more than myself; I knew my feet could easily slip. With friends supporting me by words and actions, I slowly gained ground. Finally we came to the worst section yet. To me the slope looked very close to vertical. The slight handholds were few and far between. Being short, I knew the stretches would be difficult enough in normal conditions. In my current panic, it would be much worse. The alternative was to go back down. Which was more difficult? I didn't want to go either way, but obviously I had to go somewhere. The trouble was, we were not getting any nearer to the falls. By now, we realized that this route was not the way most frequented! But knowing this did not get me any closer to safety. Since getting up this next part was next to impossible, and waiting for a rescue helicopter was not an option, with fear and trembling I decided to go down, but not by myself. Melody agreed to go with me, earning my eternal gratitude. She paused to pray for safety; I did not trust my voice enough to pray aloud. Now, with our backs to the rocks, the drop was continually in our line of vision. It seemed even steeper than before. The song "Angels Watching Over Me" ran through my head as we began, Melody going first. I kept up a steady stream of chatter, my trembling voice betraying my fear. One of the first tough places we came to gave us trouble. Cautiously stretching one foot down, Melody could not reach the bottom of the boulder. A slip would mean an extremely long drop. So we tried a different route where a fall would be shorter. It was somewhat wet and would entail a short slide to reach the bottom. Melody made it safely. I hesitated, unsure of my footing, and picturing myself at the bottom of the cliff, bones broken and pain wracking my body, if I still lived. \"You can do it! I'm right here,\" Melody called. She waited patiently, not pressuring me to hurry. Inching carefully to the edge, I could see in the corner of my eye the boulders and river far below. As I started down the rock, my foot slipped! My heart jumped into my throat as the terror I had held just under the surface swept over me. I’m gonna fall! I inwardly shrieked. It had been only a small slip, however; I was not in midair! I took a few calming breaths, and my heart repositioned itself where it belonged. With no further mishaps, we came eventually to the last troublesome spot, the stretch between two boulders that had given me problems on the way up. Thankfully, the rest of our friends had given up climbing to the top and had now caught up to us. There were two possible descents from here. One way included a short jump down. I decided to check out the other way. Seth was working his way down this second route when he fell a few feet and bruised himself! I again looked over the first option. Do I want to jump? There’s a big drop if I jump wrong or don’t stop on the ledge! But the other way…! I knew if I was to get down, it would have to be Seth’s way. He was willing to help me however he could. I inspected the \"path\" he had taken. There was some low vegetation, matted down and sloping slightly toward the edge. Then came a drop down to a narrow inlet between rocks. That was not so bad. The hitch lay in the fact that there was no handholds or footholds, and my short legs would not reach to the rocks. \"Uh, I don’t know about this. I don’t like the looks of it!\" I said, my voice quavering. \"You can make it, Amy! I'm right here. I won’t let you fall,\" Seth promised. Slowly, painstakingly, I backed over the vegetation. \"I’m coming down,\" I warned, my voice unsteady. \"I’m ready,\" answered Seth. \"I got you.\" His assurances gave me the strength to go on. I trusted him implicitly. Flattening myself onto my belly, I edged my feet into midair. Seth held them tightly and slowly lowered me, guiding my feel to a firm place as I let my body slide over the leaves, twigs, and rock. When my feet made contact with the solid rock, I heaved a huge sigh of relief. I could feel the fear draining out of me. My arms and legs were scratched up; I was dirty and sweaty. But none of it mattered. I was at the bottom! \"Yaaaaaaahhhh!\" I yelled. I never felt so alive, and so thankful for that life."
9, "The House on Medford Avenue I have lived in three places in my entire life. The first home I remember living in was mis abuelos house. I lived in the upper flat of their duplex until I was three years old. My brother was fifteen years old, and my sister was six years old. I am the youngest in my small family. We moved out of that house because mi abuela and my mother were not getting along very well. They argued constantly, screaming so loudly that the neighbor’s windows started to shake. When we left, we only moved 20 blocks away. We moved into another duplex, but this time we stayed for one year. I saw a mouse rolling a ball of yarn through my room. We moved to Medford Avenue when I was six years old. I vividly remember stepping out of our old Ford Taurus that was on the verge of dying at any moment and looking at my dream home in awe. It was beautiful like a flower just coming into bloom. I saw my Grandmother Vivian walk out of the amazing setting. It was another duplex. My new home was in the upper flat. My dreams slowly started to fade away like the steam floating off a cup of hot coffee. I was living with my grandmother, whom I had never really spoken to. I knew that I wasn’t going to be happy there. I discovered that that was an understatement. My Niece Is Born! My brother is exactly 11 years and 9 months older than me. He met my sister-in-law when I was about three years old. I have known her basically my whole life. My brother and my sister-in-law got married, and all of a sudden I had a new sister. Little did I know that just a short time later I would have a niece. My brother told me the terrific news when I was only ten years of age. I was going to be an aunt. I spent eight grueling months preparing for the responsibility. I had a plan in my head about how great it was going to be. She was going to dress like me, and we were going to hang out at the mall together. Then she was born, and all of my plans were gone. She was only a baby. The diapers, the vomit, the crying were all grating. A jackhammer of a headache banged in my head. How was I supposed to watch her and play video games at the same time? Too much responsibility for me. I was as cold as ice to her. I would not pick her up, and I would not change her diapers. I felt like a lump of coal. I decided to make it up to her when she was old enough to walk. I would take her everywhere with me, and I did. She is now my best friend, even though she is only five years old. I wouldn’t trade her for anything. The Day My Grandmother Died . . . Or Maybe Four Days Later My grandmother was sick for a long time. She lost her memory so gradually that it was like sand in an hourglass slowly slipping away. I can’t remember when she actually got sick, but I knew that I would have to grow up very quickly. We took care of her for a while, and then we had to admit her into a nursing home. I went to see her two days before my trip to Washington, D.C. She did not know who I was, but she just smiled at me like she always did. They said that she was fine, that she was in perfect health. We left, and I went home to prepare for my trip. She died six days later. It was the day after my return home. We did not find out until about four days later. Something was odd about that day. My mom picked me up early from school, and she looked very sad. In a joking way, I asked, \"Who died?\" I did not know that someone did. My mom took me to work, and I spent two hours trying to figure out what was wrong. My mom came in with an umbrella and asked me if I could walk home. Tears were in her eyes, and they looked as if they were going to explode like a dam overflowing with water. I said, \"Sure,\" and I started walking home. When I got home, my mom and dad told me to sit down in the living room. My dad said that Grandmother had expired. I couldn’t speak. All of my words were stolen. I cried endlessly, like a waterfall after the rain. I can’t remember much of that day. I remember calling my friend Chris and telling him that I was going to be okay. Then everything blacked out like the darkness of space and time. My First Boyfriend . . . Sort Of It all started on the first day of my horrible high school career. I remember walking through that big school on the gray, evil morning. I walked to my resource room and sat down right next to the guy who would turn my world upside down. I remember looking toward the window and seeing his spiking hair outline against the dreary horizon. He was looking at me. I knew that he must have been looking at a girl behind me or something. He couldn’t possibly be looking at me. Boy, was I wrong. Fast forward to our first school dance. It was the weirdest dance I have ever been to. I knew only one person at the school, and she did not even show up. I walked into the loud, dark, cave-like room. I noticed his spiky hair and I decided to ask him if he saw a mutual friend of ours. I walked up to him quickly, avoiding any eye contact. \"Have you seen Ashlie?\" \"Huh?\" \"I said have you seen Ashlie!\" \"Huh?!\" His friend pushed his head into mine. I looked at him quickly and ran away with the speed of lightning. All night long his friends pushed him toward me. A random girl came up to me and snatched my hand like it was a purse full of new bills. She pulled me toward him and made us exchange phone numbers. That wasn’t the end. The invention of the dreaded Crush can made all of it worse. He sent a Crush can to me. Now, this was a curse. Many girls liked him, and they practically threw themselves at him. Basically every girl in my phy ed class hated me. He sent me the highest Crush can there is—red . . . the color of fire . . . the color of love. After that everything was great . . . sort of. He sent me three balloons on my birthday. He acts like he is my boyfriend, but the problem is . . . he has never asked me out! My Best Friend(s) I have three best friends, and they are all very different. They have different tastes and personalities. They are all special in their own ways. My friend Megan is the strangest but the coolest person I know. She always finds ways to make me laugh, and she is always there for support. We have known each other since sixth grade, but we became best friends during the eighth grade. She helped me through a bunch of problems. I go to her with all of my guy problems . . . including the most recent problems. Without her, I would be lost. My friend Catherine is the total opposite of Megan, but she is still as cool as a cucumber. She is Mormon, and she really believes in her religion. I respect her for that. She is always there when I need a shoulder to cry on. She is extremely nice, and she is as sweet as sugar. She is really cool to hang out with at the mall because we both have the same style in clothing. I have only known her for a year, but I feel like I have known her forever. My friend Chris is my protector. He is like a big brother (but I am older than he is). He will intimidate anyone who decides to mess with me. I can talk to him about anything (and he doesn’t like most of it), and he will give the guy’s opinion on everything. He’s great to just hang with on a Saturday and play football or soccer with. Without these people I would not have a home. Sure, I have shelter and a roof over my head, but that doesn’t make a home. My home is happiness and love. It is caring and sharing. It is dealing with the good times and the bad. Home is with the people I love. Home is in my heart."
9, "Adam’s Train of Ghosts  Something happens inside of me when I listen to the music of the Counting Crows. Raw, uncensored emotion pours from the mouth of lead singer Adam Duritz. His voice seems to naturally synthesize with the background music of guitars, pianos, organs, drums, and accordions. When Adam sings, it’s as if he’s ripped open his chest and is exposing his heart and all of its contents, regardless of the cost, because that’s how much his emotions mean to him. The words of Adam’s self-written songs (lyrics and piano music) can speak to anybody and convey a vivid mental picture of the mood present in the music. The band’s music and Adam’s lyrics are best described in the following quote: Take autumn, with all its leaves falling off of the trees, and the green turning to gold . . . and then the sodden brown of winter, the coming chill in the air, the sudden clarity of the moon at night, the aching melancholy felt as summer rolls away behind you, and the world of winter wraps itself around you. If you could take all of this, and all that it means and suggests, and turn it into music, you would have the Counting Crows. Adam Duritz was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but lived in Boston, Denver, and Dallas before settling down with his family in San Francisco. Before leading the Crows, Adam was an English major at the University of California at Davis and at Berkeley in the late ’80s. He quit school without turning in his thesis because he thought that it wasn’t very good. Between the time he dropped out of school and formed the band, Adam worked a wide array of jobs, getting fired from each one. An insomniac, Adam has had plenty of idle time to be productive. He claims that his inability to sleep is due to his uneasiness about letting go of consciousness. He says he can’t allow himself to do it. During sleepless nights, Adam’s true poetic genius takes over. He just lets himself go, pouring onto paper thoughts about his past relationships and other memories. Any avid listener will notice that a few recurring metaphors are present in Adam’s songs: that memories are ghosts and relationships are trains. The first of these two metaphors is pretty self-explanatory; however, the second needs some explanation. Adam believes that getting into a relationship is similar to boarding a train and riding to a final destination with the other person. He feels that in order to be in a relationship, one must be willing and able to live with the other person’s ghosts. It’s quite a beautiful concept about the trains. In his song \"Ghost Train,\" Adam sings, \"Love is like a ghost train rumbling through the darkness. Remember everything when only memory remains.\" Another characteristic that an avid Crows listener will notice is that Adam often sings about particular women. There’s Maria, Elizabeth, Amy, Anna, Shannon, Amanda, Lisa, and Margery, just to name a few. The two who appear most frequently in Adam’s lyrics are Maria and Elizabeth. Adam has said in interviews that Maria is like the female version of himself. He uses this fictional character in his songs when he wants to express his thoughts but not make it apparent that the song is about him. (However, he has said that most of his songs are about him or his experiences because that’s all he knows.) Elizabeth is an ex-girlfriend of Adam’s. They were a couple when the Crows caught their first true glimpse of fame. Elizabeth was in college at the time that Adam was on the road touring. She was obsessed with the fear that Adam was cheating on her (which he claims he wasn’t). As in most cases, the long-distance relationship didn’t work out. Adam comments that the breakup was for the best; however, his songs including Elizabeth indicate otherwise. The song \"I Wish I Was a Girl\" on the album This Desert Life is about Adam’s desire to make Elizabeth realize that he was faithful to her during the time that he was away. There’s a double standard when girls say that they were faithful and they’re generally believed, but when guys say it, nobody believes them. Another song, \"Goodnight Elizabeth,\" from the album Recovering the Satellites is Adam’s lullaby dedicated to Elizabeth. The lyrics basically express that Adam will always carry a piece of Elizabeth with him. The lyrics say, \"I wish you were inside of me/I hope that you’re OK/I hope you’re resting quietly/I just wanted to say/Goodnight, Elizabeth, goodnight.\" He refers to himself as the king of the rain in a few songs, much like Jim Morrison is also known as the Lizard King. I’ve tried to figure out what this rain symbolism means, and my hypothesis is that rain could mean tears or just a bad situation. Possibly he feels that he inadvertently causes a lot of problems for the people he cares about. As he sings in the song \"Chelsea,\" \"The things I do to people I love just shouldn’t be allowed.\" He is quite absorbed in his own feelings, which is sometimes interpreted as egotism, but I get the impression that he’s unsure of his true identity and doesn’t really believe in himself. Since he is very sensitive and constantly searching his soul, he’s become infatuated with his own feelings. He’s absorbed in feelings, and I think that people have interpreted that infatuation as egotism. Adam’s poetic lyrics move me to the depths of my soul. With just a few words and the emotion in his voice, he can make me feel as if there is a starry summer night inside of me . . . or a lonely, empty hotel room. There is nostalgia behind his lyrics and a canvas painted with love, loneliness, devotion, and disappointment. During the production of the band’s first album, Adam’s most important goal was to \"make a mark upon the world.\" If it’s worth anything, he’s made more than just a mark upon my world; he has painted me a sky and filled it with stars."
9, "Diary of Gaspard  May 12, 1780 How can I go on living? My one and only child was taken away from me tonight. It started out as a calm and normal night. It never occurred to me that in only a few short hours I would lose my child, my world, my life. I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew something was going to happen. I do not know why I sent my child outside. But as soon as he left, I heard horses. It sounded as if they had hit something. I ran out of the house as quickly as possible, but I was too late. My child was on the road, bleeding from the head. I ran to my child’s side. I tried to revive him. I called out his name, but I knew that he could not hear me. He was gone. I screamed that he was dead, that he had been killed. I tried to get someone to help, but the only person who spoke was the man in the carriage. His name was Monsieur the Marquis, and I will die despising that name. He had no sympathy at all. My child was beneath his carriage, and he told me that I did not know how to care for my children. I stood there staring at him, trying to figure out what was wrong with him. He threw a gold coin at me and asked me my name. Of course, I told him. I said something about my child’s death, and he smiled. He asked me if I was a philosopher. Why would anyone ask a question like that at a time like this? I said yes, and he asked me my profession. I told him that I was a vendor of wine. He threw another gold coin at me and told me to buy something at will. Two gold coins were supposed to make up for the loss of my son. I was enraged and threw the coins back into his carriage. I fell to my knees and started sobbing. I did not know what else to do. He stuck his head back out of the carriage and yelled as if he were insulted. I just want to know how I can go on living without the one thing that mattered most to me. It will be extremely hard, and I do not think I will ever actually get over it. How can one get over such a thing? I do not know what to do. I do not know how to live. I just do not know."
9, "My Interpretation of The Joy Luck Club  Children, as they become adults, become more appreciative of their parents. In The Joy Luck Club, the attitudes of four daughters toward their mothers change as the girls mature and come to realize that their mothers aren’t so different after all. As children, the daughters in this book are ashamed of their mothers and don’t take them very seriously, dismissing them as quirky and odd. \"I could never tell my father . . . How could I tell him my mother was crazy?\" (p. 117). They don’t try to comprehend their culture, which is a big part of understanding their traditional Chinese mothers. On page 6, one of the daughters states, \"I can never remember things I don’t understand in the first place,\" referring to Chinese expressions her mother used. When their mothers show pride in them, the girls only show their embarrassment. One daughter shows her shame when she says to her mother, \"I wish you wouldn’t do that, telling everyone I’m your daughter\" (p. 101). The girls cannot relate to their mothers because they were raised in a different world. No matter how much the mothers care for them or how much they sacrifice to make their girls’ lives better, the daughters are blind to their mothers’ pain and feelings. All four of the Joy Luck mothers need their daughters to understand them, pass on their spirit after they are gone, and understand what they have gone through for their girls. One mother dreams of doing this on her trip to a new life: \"In America I will have a daughter just like me . . . over there nobody will look down on her . . . and she will always be too full to swallow any sorrow! She will know my meaning because I will give her this swan . . . it carries with it all my good intentions\" (pp. 3-4). Another mother plans how she will give her daughter this perception: She [my daughter] has no chi . . . How can I leave the world without leaving her my spirit? So this is what I will do. I will gather together my past and . . . see a thing that has already happened. The pain that cut my spirit loose. I will hold that pain in my hand until it becomes hard and shiny, more clear. And then my fierceness can come back . . . I will use this sharp pain to penetrate my daughter’s tough skin and cut her tiger spirit loose. She will fight me, because this is the nature of two tigers. But I will win and give her my spirit because this is why a mother loves a daughter. (p. 286) Things don’t exactly turn out the way the mothers hope, though. Their hopes and dreams are shattered when they realize their daughters’ misconceptions of them. On page 282, a mother laments, \"When my daughter looks at me, she sees a small, old lady. If she had chuming [inside knowledge of things] she would see a tiger lady.\" One daughter sees the fear of the remaining mothers after she tells them that she doesn’t know anything about her dead mother that she can pass on: They are frightened. In me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America. They see daughters who grow impatient when their mothers talk in Chinese, who think they are stupid when they explain things in fractured English . . . They see daughters who will bear grandchildren born without any connecting hope passed from generation to generation. (p. 31)  This fear does not persist, however. As the daughters mature, the two generations discover that they aren’t so different after all. One mother says, \"She puts her face next to mine, side by side, and we look at each other in the mirror . . . these two faces, I think, so much the same! The same happiness, the same sadness, the same good fortune, the same faults\" (p. 292). One daughter, after her mother’s death, sits down to play the piano that she had refused to touch before to defy her mother. Amy Tan uses the metaphor of two piano pieces to compare the mother to this daughter: \"The piece I had played for the recital . . . was on the left-hand side of the page . . . and for the first time . . . I noticed the piece on the right-hand side . . . It had a lighter melody but the same flowing rhythm [as the recital piece and] . . . was longer but faster. And after I played them both . . . I realized they were two halves of the same song\" (p. 155). The daughters, as they grow to be adults, become more appreciative of their mothers. Their attitudes change over time to create an understanding and respect that hadn’t been there before: I saw what I had been fighting for. It was for me, a scared child, who had run away a long time ago to what I had imagined was a safer place. And hiding in this place, behind my invisible barriers, I knew what lay on the other side: her side attacks. Her secret weapons. Her uncanny ability to find my weakest spots. But in the brief instant that I had peered over the barriers I could finally see what was really there: an old woman, a wok for her armor, a knitting needle for her sword, getting a little crabby as she waited patiently for her daughter to invite her in. (pp. 203-204) In conclusion, as children, the daughters didn’t understand their mothers or their culture. The daughters were being raised in a different world. Their perceptions of their mothers changed, though, as they grew up and realized that they weren’t so different from them after all. They finally understood and respected their traditional Chinese mothers."
9, "Mama’s Stitches  Mama’s stitches color me like dark crayons striking paper; my beautiful Mama’s stitches find me on the rainy days I try to hide. Broken vase upon cold tile; sorry Mama, Mama—I’ll be better than the little girl I was last week; you said I needed fixing. Stitches, stitches, you say will hold me together; if not now, then forever. I’ll understand one day, how papas lie and kiss their bottles instead of mamas. Oh, Mama, Mama, black and blue the kids at school ask why I have these stitches and I smile and say they’re glue. I’ll stay together better than the best of you. Mama used to sing for me but Papa taught her to learn me right and someday I won’t make the same mistakes. Mama’s stitches stay with me even when they’ve disappeared."
9, "The KHS Press  Characters Mr. Pulaski, the advisor for the KHS Press Ms. Cebon, another teacher Lena, Weasel, Beth, and Bryon, student reporters Mr. Pulaski stands behind a podium. Weasel, with a knee brace, sits at a table with his wounded leg sticking into the aisle. Beth and Bryon sit at desks. Mr. Pulaski: O.K., people. We need to start our meeting. Ms. Cebon has offered to help us with this issue because we don’t have a lot of time or staff reporters, and we need to get going. We need to find some stories. Has anyone started to— (Lena enters and interrupts Mr. Pulaski.) Lena: Sorry I’m late, Mr. Pulaski. On my way I ran— Weasel, what happened to you? Weasel: I got hit by a telephone pole. Lena: Who hit you? Bryon: Not who, a telephone pole. That is, after he hit it. Lena: What? Weasel: Yes, and if I have to tell the story one more time . . . Beth: Just tell it, Weasel. You’re perfectly fine. Weasel: Beth, do you see my knee? I am not perfectly fine. Beth: I want to hear it again, anyway. Lena, this is hilarious. Weasel: No, Beth, \"hilarious\" is not the right word. I can’t even run. That takes me out for the rest of cross-country season! Beth: It’s even on video! Lena: Where? Weasel: The police have it. Oh, fine, I’ll narrate it again. I was driving down Crest Street in my dad’s van . . . Beth: When was this? Weasel: Yesterday. I had a key on the dashboard, and it slid off when I went around a corner. I was looking for it when I, uh, hit a telephone pole. Lena: (laughing) Why would you . . . Weasel: Then the pole rolled off the windshield and into the street, causing the electrical wires to droop down over the road. I was fine, though. I was wearing my seat belt, and the air bag went off. The electric company came. The cops were there. And then a semitrailer truck came down the street and ran into the wires, which pulled the telephone pole, which hit me and Officer Packard. Lena: It hit a police officer? Weasel: Yeah, but I was the one who did a back flip through the air, got knocked out, and landed on my knee. I woke up as they were putting me in the ambulance. Lena: I’m trying not to laugh, really. Wait, how did it get on tape? Beth: The camera on the police car’s dashboard was on. Lena: Have you seen it? Weasel: No. My parents and I are going to go see it this week. Bryon: You’ll probably get to watch it again in court, too. Weasel: Oh, man. You know what, Bryon? You can just shut— Mr. Pulaski: O.K. We’re all here, so we can begin now. Beth: Where are Danielle and Troy? Bryon: They’re in Mexico on some school trip. Lena: (to Weasel) So you can’t run at all? Weasel: No, so there goes the team’s chance of winning conference again this year. Lena: How about the van? Weasel: Totaled. Lena: Any kittens killed while you were at it? (Weasel gives her a dirty look.) Just kidding!Weasel: No, no kittens involved. But when the wires snapped, they tore the chimney off a house across the street. Lena: Now you’re just giving me a hard time. Mr. Pulaski: No, that did happen. People, we need a newspaper here. (Bryon raises his hand.) Yes, Bryon? Bryon: A newspaper would be great, but first we need some stories. Mr. Pulaski: Yes, at our last meeting we discussed step one of journalism: find a story. I’m glad you remembered that. Does anyone have any possible stories to cover? (silence) We do have a deadline. Lena: When? Mr. Pulaski: Three weeks. Lena: Hey, Weasel, doesn’t Principal Jones live on Crest Street? Weasel: Yes. Lena: Isn’t his the only house on Crest Street? Weasel: (sighing) Yes. Mr. Pulaski: So no one has any stories? Weasel: (getting up on his crutches to leave) Mr. Pulaski, you could give us three months and not much would happen in this school. But we do have three weeks, so how about we all try to find something to cover by our next meeting. (He exits.) Bryon: Right. We need more time to find newsworthy topics. See ya, Mr. P., Ms. Cebon. (He exits.) Beth: I would look for stories now, but Senator Menlan is speaking to the student council at three o'clock. (She exits.) Lena: Don’t worry, Mr. Pulaski. I’ll dig up some stories for you after I go to the airport to greet our foreign exchange student from Swaziland. (She exits.) Ms. Cebon: How long will it take them to figure it out? Mr. Pulaski: Oh, it usually takes them until about two days before the deadline. (They exit.)"
9, "Rosa Parks  At their Web site, students from Lincoln Bassett Community School answer the question \"Who is Rosa Parks?\" I think Rosa Parks was a woman who stood up for what she believed in. —Brittney Hammett  She was a woman who had the guts to stand up for what she believed. —Jessie Alexander  Several other students also answered the question, responding with phrases like \"my hero\" and \"queen mother of the revolution.\" Rosa Parks is often considered as just these things, remembered as the tired seamstress who refused to give up a bus seat to a white man in 1955. Parks, however, was—and still is—much more than that. Rosa Louise McCauley was born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskeegee, Alabama, to her parents, Leona, a teacher, and James, a carpenter. At the age of 2, she moved to Pine Level, Alabama, with her mother and younger brother, Sylvester, to live on her grandparents’ farm. At age 11, she began education at the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls, a private school founded by women from the northern United States, and then went on to the Alabama State Teachers College. With her husband, Raymond Parks, she settled in Montgomery and joined the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She served as secretary of the NAACP and later as advisor to the NAACP Youth Council. Several times Parks tried to register to vote. These activities made the \"bus incident\" seem more than just a local ordinance violation. On Thursday, December 1, 1955, 43-year-old Parks boarded a city bus for the ride home after work (she was a seamstress at the time). Following the local ordinance that segregated blacks and whites, she sat in the fifth row of the bus, the closest \"colored\" row to the front, along with three other black people. The first four rows of the bus filled after a few stops, and one white man was left standing. The bus driver, James F. Blake, told the four in the fifth row to move. Three did, but Parks refused. The ordinance forbade blacks and whites from sitting next to one another on buses, and the driver said that if she did not move, he would call the police to have her arrested. Parks may have been tired after a day at work, but she was exhausted by the way African Americans were being treated. Parks was not the first person arrested for violating the ordinance, but she was the first well-known person in the Montgomery African American community to be arrested for it, setting off a chain of events that changed American history. Leaders in the Montgomery area, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Rev. Ralph Abernathy, and Jo Ann Robinson (head of the Women’s Political Council), feeling that some sort of protest was needed, held a meeting that weekend to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. On Monday evening, another meeting was held, and everyone voted to continue the boycott. From December 5, 1955, to December 20, 1956, 90 percent of the blacks who normally rode buses in Montgomery participated in the boycott. Parks’ arrest led not only to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, but also to headlines for the NAACP and the civil rights movement and national recognition of leaders such as King. Literally and, perhaps, ironically, Parks had refused to \"stand up\" for what she believed in; and by remaining seated, she went beyond taking a stand. Her case went all the way to the Supreme Court, and on November 13, 1956, racial segregation on public transportation was declared unconstitutional. In 1957, Parks and her husband moved to Detroit and founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, offering guidance to young African Americans in leadership and careers. In 1994, Rosa Parks was attacked in her home by a man wanting money from her. Parks, with the quiet faith and determination she showed the world in 1955, says she prays for him. According to writer Kira Albin, \"Parks’ belief in God and her religious convictions are at the core of everything she does.\" Parks’ book, Quiet Strength, spreads this message. In an interview, she gave these recommendations: \"The advice I would give to young people is, first of all, to rid themselves of prejudice against other people and to be concerned about what they can do to help others, and, of course, to get a good education and to take advantage of the opportunities they have.\" Rosa Parks said, \"I think the American Dream should be to have a good life and to live well and to be a good citizen; I think that should apply to all of us.\" She stands out in American history as a person who, in the course of a regular day, found the opportunity to stay seated for what she believed in and to educate and help others to understand this belief."
9, "Should Smoking Be Banned in Public Restaurants?  In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide—without the government’s help—if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers, but the ultimate issue is choice (Ruwart 1). When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries. Our government aims to protect us—to save us from society’s evils. However, in an attempt to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking (second hand smoke)—of which, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 1994, \"the statistical evidence does not . . . support a conclusion that there are substantive health effects . . .\" (Krauthammer)—the feds have failed to protect a vital part of the U.S. economic population: business owners. Many people who drink also tend to smoke; banning drinkers from smoking has hurt business in some bars and restaurants. \"According to the California Licensed Beverage Association, business has dropped as much as 85 percent . . . since the prohibition took effect\" (\"Bar Owners Vow\" 1). The decrease in customers and subsequent loss of revenue has far-reaching effects on employers. A study by the American Beverage Institute entitled \"Effect of 1998 California Smoking Ban on Bars, Taverns, and Night Clubs\" asked 300 respondents about the effects of the ban on their businesses. When asked if the ban caused owners to lay off employees or cut working hours, 29.7 percent of respondents answered \"yes\"; 59 percent gave the same answer when asked if they experienced a loss of tips/gratuities for bar and serving-staff employees (1). The plight of restaurant and bar owners is often ignored, but it is a serious issue for them and for their employees. While the argument rages over the effects of smoking on public health, the question that remains is this: \"How much is society entitled to penalize smokers for their decisions because—in society’s view—those decisions are unhealthy?\" (Samuelson). Smoking tobacco is not an illegal act, yet the 25 percent of Americans who do smoke are often treated as if they were criminals. They are incessantly nagged, blamed for numerous illnesses and unpleasantries, and made to feel guilty by self-righteous nonsmokers (Bork 28). The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that living with a smoker increases your chance of lung cancer by 19 percent. What they fail to tell you is that, in contrast, (firsthand) smoking increases your chance 1,000 percent (Buckley). Why is the act of smoking tobacco, which merely injures oneself, so scrutinized and shunned by society, while drinking alcohol, which is by far more deadly to innocent bystanders, is accepted by society and virtually unregulated? (Krauthammer). One may not wish to be seated near an extremely obese person in a restaurant, but it would certainly be unconstitutional to deny service to these patrons. In modern society, the government knows better than to discriminate against minorities, senior citizens, or the physically handicapped; it does not hesitate, however, to discriminate against smokers. Personal choice is a simple principle that is highly valued in American society. Banning smoking in all public restaurants violates this principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers. Like the black Southerner turned away because of racial segregation, the smoker is unfairly treated. Sadly, just when our government claims to be whisking away the clouds of smoke, it is legislating a cloud of discrimination."
9, "The Killer Bean  The picture may seem familiar. Tumbling out of bed and stumbling around in the kitchen—you begin your day. But wait. It cannot begin properly without that daily ritual, the morning cup of coffee. The aroma swirls throughout the room. What can compare to the richness and fullness of that first cup of coffee? Americans lead the world in coffee drinking, consuming an average of 3.4 cups per person per day (Pennybacker 18). Gourmet coffee houses are sprouting up all over the place. But what is the real story behind this dark brown liquid? Is it as innocent as it first seems—just a pleasant morning pick-me-up? Unfortunately it isn’t. Much of today’s coffee is grown in such a way that it damages the environment, although it has been proven that there are far less harmful methods. Coffee grows only in the tropics, in Mexico, Central and Latin America, Indonesia, and Africa. The field must be at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 feet with a temperature between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. For optimum growth, coffee must have shade from nearby trees and overhead growth, but it also requires at least two hours of sunlight each day (\"Shrinking Shadowland\" 60). These are the only requirements necessary for coffee to grow well. Coffee comes from small green beans that are really pits of a fruit resembling a cherry. The morning coffee poured into a mug comes from a small tree (or bush) that grew for seven years before it bloomed and grew the fruit that held the beans. After one of these trees produced one pound of coffee, its life was over (\"Shrinking\" 61). It was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that coffee seeds from the Middle East took to the fertile soil of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. It spread rampantly, with demand for the coffee growing in the northern part of the world. Millions of acres of rainforest and jungle were planted with coffee trees. However, that was not a completely detrimental move. Because of coffee’s need for shade and its ability to be grown alongside other crops, it didn’t originally pose a hazard or threat to the environment. Habitats for animals were not drastically changed; indeed, the tropical ecosystems were much the same as before because the small coffee trees growing near the ground didn’t require any forests to be cleared or plants eliminated. But this took a bad turn in 1970 when U.S. agricultural scientists decided to develop a new, high-yield coffee plant that grew only in the full sun. Farmers were easily convinced to adapt to this modernization because they could produce five times more coffee than before (Wille 63). With the support of local governments and the U.S. subsidization of $80 million towards the promotion of the new plant, it isn’t difficult to understand why many traditional coffee fields quickly became modern ones (Greenberg 27). As as result, over the past 40 years, Central America has lost two-thirds of its rainforests to coffee plantations at a rate of 40 million acres per year (Pennybacker 18). That figure is similar to Mexico. These modern coffee plantations are so disastrous because they are mono-cultural; nothing can grow in the fields besides the stubby coffee bushes. According to Elizabeth Skinner, a director of the Rainforest Alliance, these modern plantations \"create ecological deserts\" that are growing at an alarming rate (\"Shrinking\" 63). As the rainforests disappear, so do the animals, especially migratory birds. One study found that bird species in coffee plantations have diminished by 94-97 percent since many farmers switched to sun-grown plantations. This is not surprising considering the fact that two-thirds of birds found in shade-grown coffee plantations live in the canopy of the trees, and less than ten percent actually feed among the coffee plants (\"Why Migratory Birds\" 2). At the turn of the century, there were 65 species of common migratory birds found in Guatemala. Today, only one-third of these birds have stable populations, another one-third seem to be in decline and 25 species are missing (Wille 62). Despite this, as Wille writes, \"No place in the world attracts such an extraordinary concentration of winter residents\" (59). For example, in Guatemala, which is the same size as Ohio, there can be found in winter almost as many bird species as is found in the U.S., Central, and Latin America during the rest of the year. In fact, one-third of all migratory bird species that breed in the U.S. make that southern tropical part of the world their winter destination (Wille 59). However, the continued loss of rainforests due to sun-grown coffee fields is making it more and more difficult for these birds to find a place to migrate each winter. As the number of the birds decreases in Central and Latin America due to the spread of the sun plantations, they will also become a rarer sight in North America. Already in the last two decades of coffee industrialization, the number of birds detected by the National Weather Service Radar crossing the Gulf of Mexico has been depleted by half (Pennybacker 19). Not only do full-sun plantations threaten the existence of migratory birds, they are damaging to the environment in other ways as well. Due to the nature of the hybrid variety, the full-sun coffee plants possess little inbred resistance to pests and disease. This makes the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers necessary. It has become so mandatory, in fact, that coffee trees are the third most heavily sprayed crop in the world following cotton and tobacco (\"Shrinking\" 69). Seventy percent of the world’s coffee is sprayed with synthetic chemicals, some of which have been banned in the U.S. for years. Although not harmful to the coffee drinker because of the roasting process, the large amount of chemicals sprayed do harm the workers who cultivate the coffee. In July 1993, 60 laborers on a Colombian coffee plantation were injured and one killed after they were exposed to high levels of endosulfan, a pesticide banned in many developed countries but commonly used on coffee plantations (\"Shrinking\" 64). These pesticides and fertilizers also kill insects and microrganisms and pollute the water. Sun plantations also contribute to soil erosion. The coffee trees must face not only the blasting heat with no protection, they must also endure the pounding rain from tropical rainstorms, which gradually washes much of the soil into little wandering toxic streams. Sun coffee fields are financially risky for the farmer because they can be damaged by harsh weather and because they limit farmers to one-crop farming. What then is the solution? What will reverse this potential ecological disaster? It is ironic that the solution can be found in the problem. Growing coffee on shade plantation rather than sun plantations doesn’t strip the ecosystem to its bare bones; instead it will sustain it. There are many advantages to growing coffee on shade plantations. Shade farms can cultivate other crops, including cacao, fruit, avocados, and trees for firewood. This provides security for the farmer and promotes richer ecological diversity. The trees grown along with the coffee bushes on shade plantations add nitrogen into the soil. The leaf litter is home for many insects that devour the organisms that attack roots, while the shade trees protect coffee plants from the harsh rain and sun, help maintain soil quality, and reduce the need for labor-intensive weeding (\"Why Migratory Birds\" 3). Another advantage of shade farms is that plants and animals like to call these areas home. Due to the diversity of plants and trees found in shade plantations, the plantations are said to \"mimic natural forests\" (Wille 60). Researchers have found 66 species of trees and shrubs and 73 wildlife species in one single field. Full-sun fields host only 20 species of animals and plants (Wille 62). On one full-sun plantation no midsize terrestrial mammals were to be found, contrasting with 24 that were found on a full-shade plantation (Wille 63). These shade farms not only have a positive effect on the environment in general, but more specifically they are beneficial for migratory birds. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center has found over 150 species of birds on coffee fields and crop cacao plantations. That number is larger than all other habitats on the planet except for untouched tropical forests, which are disappearing at an alarming rate (\"Why Migratory Birds\" 1). In Mexico, the Caribbean islands, and Colombia, the areas where most migratory birds populate, the shade plantations are virtually indistinguishable from true forests and cover 2.7 million hectares, or almost half of the permanent cropland (\"Why Migratory Birds\" 2). Likewise, in Mexico coffee plantations cover an area over half the size of all the major moist tropical forest reserves, providing woodland habitat in areas where almost no large reserves are found. In El Salvador the traditional shade coffee plantations are about the only canopy habitat left in the country and account for about 60 percent of the surviving forested areas (Pennybacker 18). For this reason, the Salvadoran Minister of Agriculture and Livestock has officially classified coffee plantations as forest, alluding to the increasingly important role they play in the environment. Much of the coffee grown in that part of the world is for export to other countries, especially to the U.S. It is the third most common import in the U.S., coming only after oil and steel. Of all the coffee produced in the world, Americans consume one third of it. Each year coffee brings in revenues of $10 billion (\"Why Migratory Birds\" 3). With this much control of the market, it shouldn’t be too difficult for Americans to push for a more ecologically sound method of cultivating coffee, such as the use of shade plantations. Organic coffee is readily available in stores for the environmentally conscious and is certifiably grown without the use of chemicals and pesticides, likely on shade farms. While it is growing in popularity, organic coffee still makes up less than one percent of the 6.3 billion pounds of coffee imported into the U.S. each year (Pennybacker 19). The merits of full-sun coffee plantations don’t even begin to measure up to the benefits of shade plantations. Shade plantations benefit both the workers and the environment. The few extra dollars paid for organic coffee might make the difference between seeing that black-throated green warbler in your yard again next spring or not."
9, "To: Mr. Marcus Subject: Mid-Project Report on History Paper Here’s an update on my history paper about China. At first I had trouble finding information on my topic, but I’ve made this progress. I went to the library, and Ms. Pate showed me how to use the computer for my search. After I showed you my project proposal, I took your advice to look at either Chinese dating practices or wedding traditions, but not both. After researching both topics, I found several sources on Chinese wedding traditions, but only a few on dating practices. So I will write about present-day Chinese wedding customs I found a Web site with information about Chinese wedding traditions at www.travelchinaguide.com. For my primary research, I interviewed Donna Sung, our foreign exchange student from Shanghai, about her experiences of weddings in China. I will finish my first draft by next Wednesday and will be on schedule for the deadlines I gave you in my project proposal. Thanks, Danielle"
9, "To: Anne Cline Subject: Vegetarian Lunch Options at Bay High Dear Ms. Cline: Last summer I became a vegetarian. After visiting my uncle’s farm in Iowa, I couldn’t bear the thought of eating meat anymore. When school started, I thought I could eat school lunches by simply staying away from meat dishes. My plan worked for a few weeks, but it got tough to eat peanut-butter sandwiches and applesauce every day. The school lunch program is great for most students, but it doesn’t work well for vegetarians. After talking with other vegetarian students, I believe that the lunch program can work for everyone. Some options are to have a greater variety of side dishes and a salad bar every day that even nonvegetarians could enjoy. The school lunch program would then provide something for everyone. I was happy with the school lunches before I became a vegetarian, and I hope that now you will be able to offer meals that I can enjoy just as much. Sincerely, Karin K."

Then they saw a little island up ahead. \"Let's go to it,\" said Olivia. \"No! Don't go,\" said Amy. \"It could be dangerous.\" \"I'll let you sunbathe,\" said Olivia. \"Let's go! Don't waste any time,\" Amy said rushed. So they swam to the island. When they got there Amy laid down and started to sunbathe right away. But Olivia decided to collect some coconuts for lunch instead of sunbathing. \"I'm hungry,\" said Amy. \"Do we have any food?\" \"Yes, we do. I collected coconuts while you were sunbathing.\" \"Let's start eating them,\" said Amy."

Duh, you're under arrest. By the way, what does arrest mean?\" asked Gerald. \"It means to capture somebody and put them in jail,\" said Bob. \"Oh, yeah. Is it legal?

As long as it is purple, orange, and has yellow polka dots and blue, solver, and gold stripes,\" said Bob. \"Okay. I'll get to work,\" said Gerald, and pulled a paintbrush out of nowhere. \"Where'd the paintbrush come from?\" asked Bob, \"Duh, I got it at John Painter's store,\" said Gerald. \"Okay. You better get to work,\" said Bob. \"Okay,\" said Gerald, and with a swish of his cape, he was off. \"Finally! Some peace and quiet from that loudmouth!\" said Bob. Then, just as he had planned, de quietly snuck away. Just then, Gerald flew through the window. \"Which do you want? Baby blue, light blue, or dar...Bob? Bob? BOB?\" Gerald screamed. \"What? Wadda ya want? Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?!?!\" asked Bob. \"Oh boy oh boy oh boy!

I'll call my assistant,\" said Gerald. \"Your what?\" asked Bob. But before he could say the first word, Gerald was at the window. \"Fweeoooeeet!\" Gerald whistled. Someone tried to fly in through the window, but he ended up hitting his stomach on the windowpane. \"Oof!\" said Gerald's assistant. \"Ouch,\" said Bob. \"Assistant Bane, at your service,\" he said, and fell flat on his face. \"Well, it looks like your little plan ailed! Ha, ha, ha! Bye!\" But before Bob could run off to safety, Gerald grabbed Bob by the scruff of his neck and with a terrible jerk, Bob fell backwards and he fell flat on his back on Gerald. \"Hi,\" Gerald said. \"Gaahhhh...get off me!!!\" shrieked Bob."
