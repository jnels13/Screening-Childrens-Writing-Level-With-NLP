7, "The Fight for Education    I ran as fast as I could. I could see my destination just ahead of me. Just a little further \, I kept saying to myself \, just a little further and I will have made it to the land of the free and the home of the brave \, the land of opportunity.  	Diego finally got to his destination. He had gotten to America without getting caught. Now he could get the education to become a mechanic.    	Like Diego \, many illegal immigrants come to America every day for a better life and a better education. Whether these illegal immigrants should get the education they came for is very controversial in today’s economy. Some Americans think that illegal immigrants shouldn’t be eligible for instate tuition \, but other Americans think that these illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition. I am one who thinks that illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition.  	One of the most important arguments is that illegal immigrants pay taxes. By buying goods in America they are paying sales taxes \, and in April most files and pay their [income] taxes. In fact \, illegals pay about nine billion dollars in [Social Security] taxes every year. Where do these taxes go? They go to lowering the cost of instate tuition \, making it so affordable today. So why shouldn’t the illegal immigrants be eligible for instate tuition when they are helping to lower the price of the tuition?  	Another important argument is one that our forefathers set forth to make a better nation. We hold these truths to be self-evident \, that all men are created equal…and hold unalienable rights \, among these are life \, liberty \, and the pursuit of happiness. If we are truly equal \, then illegal immigrants deserve the same rights as we do for instate tuition.  	However \, some Americans say that illegal immigrants don’t deserve instate tuition because they are sending money back to their home country and families. But we do not know how much money they are actually sending back \, and besides \, this helps spread the money around. It may even help a foreign country to get out of poverty. This could actually stop more illegal immigrants from coming to America because they would be stable enough from the money that is being sent to them so that they don’t need to look to the land of opportunity for a job.  In conclusion \, illegal immigrants should be eligible for instate tuition so \, like Diego \, they can follow their dreams. If you ever have to take a side on this issue \, I hope you will consider mine.    "

5, "Recently our class read an article in the Time for Kids Magazine. The title was Too Much Homework!? and it was about how much homework kids are doing today. It said that 100 years ago \, kids never had any homework because they had to work on their farms or do chores for their families.  	But in the 1950’s \, American kids began to score really low on math and science tests. Other countries were doing better than we were. Teachers thought that since their students were getting low grades \, they should do some homework to practice and catch up to the rest of the world. Since then students have been getting more and more  homework and it doesn’t look like that is going to change. I think that students should have enough homework \, but still have time for fun. So \, students in third grade should start having  15 minutes a night and work up to a little over an hour by the sixth grade. One reason to have homework is kids can become more responsible. For example \, if someone usually forgets a due date \, he can practice remembering and using an assignment book to help him remember his homework. When kids grow up and get a job \, they will have deadlines to meet and homework is good practice for that.  Another reason to have homework is a kid can become faster at doing his work. If he needs to practice multiplication he can do that at home better than at school. Also \, some kids who have big projects or posters would rather work where it is quiet and they can concentrate better. Also \, long searches on the Internet are done at home easier than at school because you can be comfortable at home and you don’t have a schedule to keep.  These are the reasons why I think students in third grade should start having 15 minutes a night and work up to a little over an hour by the sixth grade. If you agree with what I have said you should write a letter to a School addressed to the Superintendent and Principal so she can show it to the School Board. Thank you for your support. "
5, "Roll of Thunder \, Hear My Cry by Mildred Taylor takes place in Mississippi in the 1930’s \, a time when segregation was present. Some of the characters in this story are: the Logans (Cassie \, Stacey \, Little Man \, Christopher John \, Mama \, and Papa) \, T.J. Avery \, and Mr. Morrison. In the book \, one of the characters \, Mr. Morrison says \, In those years I suppose it was just as hard being free as it was  being a slave. In this book response \, I am going to use examples from the book to help explain why I agree with that quote.    One of the examples to support the quote is Soldiers Bridge. Soldiers Bridge is  a bridge on which white men have power over black men. The bridge has only one lane for only one car. If two people with the same skin color meet at the bridge \, the person who reached the bridge first gets to go first. If a white and a black meet at the bridge \, the white automatically gets to go first \, always. This is true even if the black wagon/car is halfway across the bridge. The blacks would have to back off the bridge \, and allow the whites to cross! This makes them feel like slaves obligated to obey their masters’ commands.    Another example is Mama losing her job. Mama lost her job as a school teacher because Mr. Granger \, who is the school district manager (and who also wants the Logans’ land) claimed that Mama was teaching inappropriate information at the school \, and should not be teaching anymore. Mr. Granger is white \, and he feels strongly that whites are better than blacks. Mama was teaching about slavery and how black women/men were treated unfairly. He wanted a reason to fire her because without her paycheck \, the Logans would not have enough money to pay the taxes for their land \, and he might be able to get it.    Another example is the Jefferson School Bus (the white school’s bus) that drives past Cassie \, Stacey \, Christopher John \, and Little Man every morning as they walk to school. The driver and the children make fun of the Logans and laugh at them. If it has rained the night before \, the driver would speed up and splash mud at the Logans. The Logan children felt mad \, and humiliated \, but they could do nothing to stop the white bus driver from doing this. They were like slaves \, because they had no control over what was happening to them.    Yet another example to support Mr. Morrison’s idea \, is the Wallace store. The Wallace store is the local store where people shop (and which also sells alcoholic beverages). Most of the white men gather at the Wallace Store to drink \, smoke \, and play cards. If black skinned people were to enter the Wallace Store \, the drinkers and smokers would insult them by calling them names \, like nigger and they would make fun of them. The blacks would also always be served last. This is like Soldiers Bridge \, because even if a black person was already being waited on \, if a white person arrived \, Mr. Wallace would stop waiting on the black person \, and help the white person. This is definitely not fair.    My last example is the textbooks that the students are given in the black school. At first the black students were all excited about the new books \, but when Little Man accepts his book \, their point of view changes completely. The new textbooks are discards from a white school \, where they were used until they were in very bad condition. Little Man ( who is very meticulous) refused to use his book because it was old and dirty. Little Man’s teacher became mad and used the whip on him.    As you can see from the situations I have explained \, life for the Logans during this time was completely unfair. They were treated unfairly \, because their skin is black. The black skinned people in this story were treated with almost no respect from the white skinned people in this story. Although slavery had ended \, these people were still treated like slaves because the whites would order them around \, and they would have to obey \, or risk their lives.  "
6, "Dear Teachers \, Parents \, and School Board \, The children in my class have been talking about the proposal that some of you have made which is whether or not our school should participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen week. I don’t think that if we did that \, it would have a positive effect on the children in our school. There are a few reasons that we might want to participate but I weighed it out and I don’t think that we should participate. These are the reasons.    One reason that I don’t think that our school should participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen week is that when we can use computers \, we can get assignments done faster during the school day so that we can move on to other things. For example \, when you are given a task to type \, if you write it by hand \, it will take a much longer time then if we just decided to type it. If we are given an assignment that we have to do research on \, we can usually get a lot more useful information from the internet then even from a book sometimes. Also \, we will be able to move on to our next subject much faster because our research or typing will be finished.    Another reason that I don’t think we should shut down our screens for a week is because the Internet is the most reliable source for information. In the article Is Google Making Us Stupid it said the internet has the world’s best images \, writing and ideas. That means that it will have better \, more honest and reliable information than even a book. The internet lets us expand our range of thinking and see things in a different way from possibly someone else’s perspective. The internet’s information lets us think better and faster. Some people say that the internet is not helping us learn and not making us brilliant but I don’t believe that is the case. I’m only eleven years old and I have already learned things off the internet like how solar power works and how animals like dolphins survive so that is obviously a myth. Google and the internet gives us ready and free access to information on just about anything.    The last reason that I think that we shouldn’t participate is because overall \, calling \, emailing \, texting \, or video chatting is more efficient. It takes less time and we are in the twenty-first century. We live in a time when it is a very normal thing to call or text someone instead of writing to them or just going to visit them. It might seem overwhelming and people might say that it is making us stupid but I find it fun and interesting to explore. I don’t think that I could go a week without music or TV! I couldn’t do it! I know for certain people this might not be the route that they want to take and that is fine but this world is only going to get more tech-like \, it really is.    As you can see \, these are the reasons that I believe that we shouldn’t participate in the Shut Down Your Screen week.         Your friend \,  "
6, "Animals are Smart    Some people think that we are superior to animals but I think that animals are as smart as we are. Pets react to your moods and seem to know just when It’s dinner time! Some animals use tools \, communicate and think for their own.     If animals can use tools \, they must be smart. For instance \, a cow named Betty made a hook out of a piece of metal wire. That’s obviously pretty smart but she didn’t stop there.She then used the hook to get treats out of a glass tube. I think this is smart because Betty figured out how to make a tool to get something she wanted. Another smart animal who used a tool was Fu Manchu the Orangutan. Fu Manchu first traded Food for wire with another orangutan and then he hid it in his mouth until the right time. Then he used the wire as a tool to pick the lock on his cage and escape. I think this shows Fu Manchu was smart because he used a tool and he outsmarted humans by escaping from his cage.    Animals who communicate might be even smarter than animals who use tools. For instance one clever gorilla actually learned sign language! Not only that but she started making her own signs. This showed scientists that she was trying to communicate her thoughts \, which takes big brainpower. I think this is smart because when Koko made her own signs it showed that she wasn’t just memorizing signs \, she was thinking and making her own signs. Another smart animal who could understand communication was Betsy the dog. Betsy understands 340 spoken words! Not only that \, but when someone showed her a picture of something she had never seen before she would go and get the item. I think this is really smart because Betsy didn’t just memorize words she could recognize objects and fetch them. Betsy didn’t really communicate \, but I think she understood so much. It’s just as good.    For animals who don’t communicate or use tools there is another category: Animals that think on their own. For example \, the poison dart Frog. Aside from protecting themselves with poison \, they have AMAZING memories! The mothers hide their pollywogs in individual nests all over the jungle and had to remember where each one is and to come back every couple days to feed them! I think that is amazing how they think for their own because every pollywog (up to 35!) is in a different \, camoflauged spot and their mom can still remember where each and every one is. Another example of animals thinking on their own is Alex \, the African grey parrot. Alex can figure out alikeness and diference between two objects. For instance \, when scientists hold up two objects and ask what the difference is he will answer either shape or color \, depending on what it was. This is really smart because not only can Alex tell the difference he can tell what is the same about some objects. I’d say that is a pretty smart bird to be able to figure out what was the same and different in his mind \, but he also translated that out into words. I’d say these animals are really smart in thinking on their own.    I know that some of you may think that animals are not smart. Some of you may think that animals are not smart. Some of you may think that most of the animals I talked about were special \, that they were bred in a lab. But animals in natural life are smart too. For instance \, a girl in my class named Erin has a farm \, and every day her dad goes out at 2:30 AM to milk them. The cows line up at 2:25 am without being told. I think that this is smart because the cows know what time it is \, AND line up early without being told. I think this is really smart of the cows. Another real life example of smart animals is my friend Mandy’s Cockatoo. Now \, you all know Cockatoos repeat what is said. This Cockatoo \, However takes it a step farther. Instead of just saying things at random times \, she actually answers the door when the doorbell is rung. She dosn’t open the door \, but she does say things like Hello \, and Come in. I think this is smart because instead of just saying random words \, she responds with the right words at right time.    My goal of this essay was to convince you that animals were smart. You may have already known this and reading this essay was a waste of time to you. Or \, you might have thought animals were not smart and still think that. If that is the case I have failed in my essay. However If you have changed your mind and now think that animals are smart \, I have succeeded! I know that animals are smart \, especially ones that use tools \, communicate \, and think for their own.  "

8, "Dear Teachers \, I believe that we should participate in shutdown your screen week. I think that everyone in the school should not use any electronics for one week. Since the invention of the computer \, cellphone and other electronics \, people have been using them more and more and more. These electronics have big upsides \, you’re never alone if you have cell service and Facebook allows people to talk to multiple friends at once when they’re not in the same room \, town \, state \, or country. But they also have their downsides. What makes us truly great is our ability to think deeply and focus \, but when we use electronics or the internet we aren’t doing either of these things. In fact \, using these things makes us think more shallow and focus less. I think that we should participate in  shut down your screen week.    One reason is that using electronics and multi-tasking causes focus problems \, on and off computers. In Attached to Technology and Paying a Price by Matt Richtel \, it says \, Scientists say juggling email \, phone calls \, and other incoming information can change how people think and behave. They say our ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information. This ability to focus is enormously important \, it’s one of the things that we depend on almost every day. Like when you’re driving a car to work or flying a plane. If you’re distracted while doing one of these things it can have dire consequences for yourself and for others. Multi-tasking can also affect creativity \, deep thought \, causing problems for work and family life. By participating we could give people a chance to develop new habits of not using their phone or computer all the time.    A second reason that we should participate is that heavy multitaskers have trouble filtering out irrelevant information on and off the computer. In Attached to Technology and Paying the Price by Matt Richtel it says the multitaskers had trouble filtering out the blue ones – the irrelevant information. If we participated \, we could give these people a chance to develop new habits that would help them filter out irrelevant information and only pay attention to the things that are important. For example \, if someone’s playing with their daughter \, they would check their email every time they received an email instead of focusing on playing with their daughter.    Now \, some people say that we shouldn’t participate because technology makes you smarter \, why stop doing something that’s helping yourself. In an imaging study by Dr. Small \, he found that Internet users showed greater brain activity than nonusers \, suggesting they were growing their neural circuitry. While they may be growing their neural circuitry \, they were also changing a characteristic of the brain that was thought to be unchangeable \, the ability to only process one stream of information at a time. This ability allows humans to think deeply \, an important characteristic in todays society. By changing it \, they were preventing themselves from having the ability to think deeply.    Technology is a new thing \, and it has many advantages and conveniences. But for many it becomes more than a convenience \, it becomes an obsession. For this reason I believe that we should participate in shut down your screen week \, to give people a chance to make new habits  and make technology a convenience again \, not a necessity. "
8, "Years Gone By;  The Importance of Great Literature  That one day little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.  -Martin Luther King \, Jr.      As years have gone by \, as we take actions and feel emotions \, we embark upon a search for something to describe the indescribable \, to understand the most complicated of thoughts \, and to ease unrelenting pain. It is in this search that we stumble upon literature \, and we have learned that it can be one of the most effective tools to both spiritually and bodily heal the wounds of human nature.    Martin Luther King \, Jr.’s message of equality is one that has stayed rooted deep in American history. He speaks of a problem that must not be neglected. In many cases \, the key to problems such as these is understanding and awareness. Through literature we find that we benefit through both. Really great literature speaks to you forever \, despite years of actions taken and emotions felt.    An example of such literature is the book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn \, by Mark Twain. Through its main character \, Huckleberry Finn \, a young \, boisterous white boy who has recently run away \, and his friend Jim \, a runaway slave \, live the values of America and the values of a very turbulent \, but loyal friendship.    Regardless of its message \, Mark Twain’s talent and its ability to withstand \, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is at risk of being taken off the shelves of schools across the country. As an American student \, I firmly believe that we must make a stand against this potentially great loss \, and make sure that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is kept in our schools and in our minds for the sake of describing the indescribable \, understanding the most complicated of thoughts and easing pain.    Some may disagree with the message conveyed by Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. With fire in their eyes they say that such a book encourages bad behavior and addresses racism in such a way that it should not be on school shelves.    First \, they find that Huck is too unlawful a child to be portrayed as a hero. He steals \, lies \, and runs away. He has no problem going against the law or his own conscience and takes pride in achievements he has been taught not to strive for \, they point out. However \, to this point we shake our head. Many \, many books have characters that lead lives that today’s children are taught against. Among the pages of The Old Testament \, Cain \, brother of Able \, stands clearly as a wrong-doer in order to help us better understand the negative forces of human nature. Though some may believe that Huck is among these undying wrong-doers \, he may well be \, like Cain \, an example of how not to act. Yet you cannot classify Huck as a bad or good person \, he is one of the many complicated characters that call the pages of great literature home. When stealing \, Huck is actually borrowing \, his lies cause him great stress and come back to haunt him. When he runs away \, he is running from an abusive father \, taking control of a situation that was headed for disaster. When he goes against his conscience it is for the sake of a friend. In that case \, Huck decides that the laws of human nature are more important than the laws that are ignorant \, laws that discriminate \, laws that could undeservingly take away what is yours. Huck is indeed no criminal \, and if anything his values are something to be admired.    Those who still believe that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn should be taken off our schools’ shelves say that it addresses racism in a way that is inappropriate for students. But that point \, like the other \, holds no water. It addresses racism in an appropriate and indeed necessary format. Like Martin Luther King Jr.’s message \, it enables us to understand and at the same time helps us become aware of how poorly African-Americans were treated during the time the book was set \, and it does this in a true-to-life and very real layout. Also \, Huck and Jim strike a friendship that white people and slaves could not have in the limits of society during the time period and this reminds the reader in many places that everyone deserves the same freedom and equality.    You must also take into account that if there is any place to read a book with possibly risky content it would be inside classrooms \, classrooms where the material would certainly be discussed and explained. In class is perhaps the safest place for one to read this book \, or any book that could result in conflicting viewpoints. To take it off the shelves of schools would be to take away the ability to help children understand and be aware of the deeper meaning \, and therefore they would be worse off than if it were to be in their schools.    In light of the past arguments \, we must now press on to show you what an excellent book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain really is. It is a book that contains important illustrations of racism and how to overcome it \, as well as many American values.    First \, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn illustrates a struggle  that has been deeply rooted in our past \, and remains deeply rooted in the present. Though we have come a long way \, a wall built of racial cloud still stands. Huck and Jim find a way to get past this wall and despite slavery and the examples set in society \, treat each other as equals. In Chapter 15, "titled Fooling Poor Old Jim Huck tries to play a trick on Jim to make fun of him \, not thinking about Jim’s feelings. When Jim discovers the truth he is deeply hurt \, but is able to express that to Huck. Hearing of his friend’s sadness \, Huck in turn apologies for his actions.    ’En when I wake up en fine you back agin \, all safe en soun’ \, de tears come \, en I could ‘a’ got down on my knees en kiss yo’ foot \, I’s so thankful. En all you wuz thinking’ ‘bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is trash; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren’s en makes ‘em ashamed.’ Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam \, and went in there without saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me  feel so mean I could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back. It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger – but I done it and I waren’t every sorry for it afterward \, neither. I didn’t do him no more mean tricks \, and I wouldn’t done that one if I’d ‘a’ knowed it would make him feel that way.    It is a very important time in this book when Jim is able to express to Huck how being lied to hurt him \, especially when he thought of Huck as a friend. After Jim has spoken of feelings and retired for bed \, Huck takes time to reflect upon his actions \, and how they made Jim feel. Fifteen minutes later \, despite what society taught him \, Huck apologies to Jim as only a friend would \, and takes what Jim says to heart.    Not only does The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn address racism in an appropriate way and remarkably find a way to overcome it \, but in many ways it reminds the reader of the important values that can only too often be forgotten in America. One of the biggest is freedom. Both Huck and Jim are searching for freedom \, escaping the imprisonment of slavery and an abusive father. Another value that is evident is equality. As expressed in the quote above \, Huck and Jim find that equality is an essential in their friendship. Through this understanding \, they manage to stay friends despite all that life throws their way.    One clear and significant value shows in this book is perseverance. Both Huck and Jim set a valiant and enduring example of this value throughout the book. Despite Huck’s father and slave catchers close on their trail; a rattlesnake skin that constantly brings them bad luck; a wrecked ship that accommodated a murder plot; a tumultuous friendship and a family blinded by bloodshed \, Huck and Jim find themselves pushing that much harder to reach the freedom that their hearts desire. They find courage and want within each other \, and as a heroic duo conquer all that flows to them upon the river of life.    There are many values evident in this book that are set down in the Declaration of Independence \, and values that have stood the test of time. This brings us back to the fact that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn must be taught in schools. As Huck and Jim lead their lives they set the examples that are crucial to students’ education. When people learn how to treat each other and learn significant values at a young age \, they are given the opportunity to apply those lessons to their future and in turn teach their children. To leave these lessons behind would be doing these students a disservice \, for it is lessons like these that teach us who we are \, who we need to be.    Great literature is a food that is scarce \, but it will always be universal. Do your part to foster its presence in your life \, and the life of the youth of America. As years have gone by \, as actions are taken and emotions are felt \, we all search for something to describe the indescribable \, to understand an idea that is conflicting \, or to ease unrelenting pain. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a possible outcome of that search \, teaching the significance of friendship \, freedom and equality. Under the nose of a visceral world \, two differing runaways find shelter in a friendship banned from society. In this friendship \, they teach the world the importance of understanding and the importance of great literature.         "
8, "We Need the League  Great people of North Dakota \,    I \, Senator McCumber \, [an actual Senator from 1919 in the League of Nations debate] \, have just participated in a debate regarding whether or not America should sign the Treaty of Versailles \, and in doing so \, join the League of Nations. The League of Nations is a unified group of nations dedicated to the preservation of peace. The League is designed to deal with international issues \, adjudicating differences between countries instead of them going directly to combat.    Now \, in the interests of the great state of North Dakota \, I voted in favor of the treaty with no reservations. We need a fair treaty to prevent future wars as horrible as the Great War was. After the war \, the central powers composed the Treaty of Versailles to create the League of Nations in an attempt to ward off future conflicts. We cannot have another war as horrible as this one. I believe \, because of that \, that we need a fair treaty \, equal to all its members \, that will restrict the use of new weapons \, and prevent future wars from breaking out.  First \, the Treaty and the League will control the use of new weapons. As stated in Article VII \, One of its (the League’s) jobs will be to come up with a plan for reducing the number of weapons around the world (arms reduction). This means that the League will be in charge of weapons issues. This will cause heavily armed countries to demilitarize and make it less possible for war to break out. This is good because heavily armed countries generally end up using those arms in some way.  Another reason why I believe we need to sign the Treaty with no reservations is we need a treaty that is fair to all its members. Reservations [proposed by the League’s opponents] would give America too much power within the league \, thus allowing America to bend the rules of the League to suit its own will. This would cause unrest in the League \, possibly causing America to make enemies. This could lead to another war. The treaty should be as fair as possible.  Yet another reason why I voted for America to sign the treaty is the fact it would prevent future wars from breaking out. The way the League is designed \, it would give plenty of time for the League to settle the countries’ differences with a fair and equal compromise. If war were to break out \, the council members in the League would all help in defending each other \, thus ending the war as quickly as possible with as few deaths as possible. The treaty would prevent war from happening or end the fighting as quickly as possible.  Some people say that we shouldn’t join the League because we would be intervening in foreign affairs \, that it would cause another war. How can you not intervene when 8 million people died in the last war? How can you stand there with  a clear conscience when you know you could have prevented all that carnage from ever happening? The League will help countries settle their differences with plenty of time to talk it over. Six months for the countries to listen to the council’s advice \, and after that another three months before they can mobilize. If we join the League \, we will keep anything like the Great War from happening again.  In conclusion \, the Treaty of Versailles needs to be signed so the League will be put into affect. The League of Nations will prevent war from breaking out \, restrict weapons development and militarism \, and keep us from the horrors of another Great War.  Thank you.        "
9, "To whom it may concern:      High School  should not participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week. Technology can be beneficial \, especially to students. A vast majority of students finds it helpful to have access to technology. Technology makes quicker \, more efficient work. Without the advancements of technology \, we are no farther along than school children in the 1960’s.    The internet and social media \, such as Facebook \, improve the social lives of those who use it. In the article Information \, Communication and Society \, a survey found that whether the participants were married or single \, people who used social media had more close friends. An average American who uses social media is half as likely to be socially isolated. They also know more diverse people. Also \, users of social media never lose ties because of relocating \, because you can always keep your friends on social media.    Internet search engines allow us better access to information. In my experience \, information is far more accessible and quick than searching through books. That allows for time to complete other class assignments. According to Peter Norvig \, director of research for Google \, Inc. \, in an article for the New York Times \, The internet contains the world’s best writing \, images \, and ideas; Google lets us find the relevant pieces instantly. Some argue that ads and irrelevant sites may be distracting \, but more find that the benefits are worth it. Eighty-one percent of experts polled by the Pew Internet Research Project  support this opinion.    The internet also makes a good learning tool. In an article by Matt Richtel for the New  York Times \, he proves that it helps our brains. Imaging studies show the brains of Internet users become more efficient at finding information. Basically \, the more we use online resources to learn \, the better our brains become at learning. Also \, in the same article \, it says \, Internet users showed greater brain activity than non-users… The internet even develops our brain to think more! Technology is improving our brains.    I have heard it argued that children rot their brains with video game systems. In the previously mentioned article by Matt Richtel \, he says \, At the University of Rochester \, researchers found that players of some fast-paced video games can track the movement of a third more objects on a screen than nonplayers…games can improve reaction time and the ability to pick out details amid clutter. It seems that the more people play fast-paced video games \, the more efficient they become at finding important details. These games may not be so brain rotting  after all. They could even be argued as beneficial.    Some also argue that because of new technologies \, people limit how much they associate together \, even in the same area. Social media disproves this argument. Not only can people associate easily with friends \, they can also chat with relatives. They can also show relatives photos \, even if they are states away. People who use social media are more likely to know more diverse people \, according to the article by Keith Hampton. People still associate with people  just as much as before \, if not more. They are merely doing it in a different manner than before social media was in use.    Cyber bullying has now become an issue. I would like to bring to attention that all bullying is a big issue. I do not think that technology has caused bullying. It has just allowed for a new way to bully someone. I have never been cyber-bullied. I personally was bullied in a face-to-face manner. A bully will take any chance to bully a target. Social media has not caused bullying.    Like most tools \, technology is useful if used correctly. Work quality on a computer can be better \, because people have more time to check over their work and improve it. Unfortunately \, some people are lazy \, and use that extra time they could use for editing for other things. That is not a problem with the tools \, it is a problem with the people. People who use such technology correctly and efficiently should still have access. If our screens are shut down \, there is no access. We should not participate in Shut Down Your Screen Week.          Sincerely\ \,9, "Is It Love?    One of the most misunderstood emotions is love. There are so many different perspectives that it can be interpreted as something completely opposite of its intention. Harper Lee \, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird states that it’s a love story \, plain and simple. This statement confuses many people because her book is anything but a romance novel. However \, that is not the kind of love she is referring to. This is the love among family \, friends \, neighbors \, and enemies. This love is called agape \, and as Martin Luther King defines it \, it is a disinterested love in which the individual seeks not his own good \, but the good of his neighbor…it begins by loving others for their sakes…it’s a love seeking to preserve and create community (King 19-20). In To Kill a Mockingbird \, love is brought up in many ways. Love is shown throughout the book as different actions by the characters coming together so they can understand each other.    Atticus shows love towards his neighbor Ms. Dubose \, even though she is completely disrespectful towards him. Everyday she insults Atticus and his children because he is defending Tom Robinson \, but he does nothing to stop her. Instead \, he sends Jem over to her house everyday for about a month to read to her. One day \, it is Atticus who goes to her house \, and he stays for most of the day. When he returns home \, he tells Jem that she has died \, and the reason he had to read to her was because  Ms. Dubose was a morphine addict(147). Atticus knew that she wanted to die free \, and he helped her achieve her goal by sending Jem to read to her \, so she could get her mind off the drug. She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody Atticus tells Jem (148). This is when Atticus and Jem realize her true determination to no longer be a morphine addict \, and it’s in this way that they both truly understand her. Even though she was dying \, Atticus still sends Jem to read to her everyday to help her become sober. Even when she is dying \, Ms. Dubose is still trying to conquer her addiction \, and it’s for that reason Atticus says \, She was the bravest person I ever knew (149). Love is shown here because even though Ms. Dubose is completely disrespectful towards Atticus \, he steps up to help her die free. This is an example of agape because instead of fighting hate with hate \, Atticus loves Ms. Dubose \, and by doing so \, he is able to understand her \, and therefore love her.    Another place love shows up is during the trial. Atticus truly believes that Tom Robinson is not guilty \, and he goes out of his way to prove his point in courts. A majority of Maycomb is mad at Atticus for even taking the case \, let alone actually trying to set him free. Atticus turns to the jury and tells them \, I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard \, come to a decision \, and restore this defendant to his family(275). Atticus fights as hard as he can to prove his case \, but it just isn’t what people want to hear. The jury votes Tom Robinson guilty \, and less than a week later he is shot. This upsets Atticus \, and especially Jem. But Atticus comforts Jem by telling him it affected somebody on the jury \, because one of the Cunninghams wanted to vote ‘not guilty. Confused \, Jem says \,  One minute they’re tryin’ to kill him and the next they’re tryin’ to turn him loose…I’ll never understand those folks as long as I live (298). Jem is too young to really understand \, but Atticus knows his case is changing the views and thoughts of racism in their community. After the trial \, Atticus is surprised to find that the entire black community gave his family a surplus of food as a thank you. This touches his heart because he starts crying \, and he tell Calpurnia to Tell them I’m very grateful (86). We again see love in this situation because Atticus got the jury to understand Tom \, even though he ends up dead. Also \, when Tom’s friends and family reach out to thank Atticus for his efforts and his true support in the trial \, we can see that there is understanding. One step at a time \, Atticus is changing the thoughts of the people in the community to make it stronger by using agape.    One of the places we see the most love is with Boo Radley. He is just a misunderstood man who Jem and Scout torment and talk about throughout the summer. Boo \, however \, does little things to change their opinion of him. One night when there is a fire \, Boo Radley comes out of his house and puts a blanket on Scout without knowing- a very loving and caring gesture. When Jem tells Atticus \, he says \, Someday \, maybe \, Scout can thank him for covering her up (96).After this \, the kids start thinking of Boo differently. One night \, after the play \, Jem and Scout are attacked in the woods by Mr. Ewell when they are walking home. Suddenly \, somebody kills their attacker and brings injured Jem home. It’s not until they are home that Scout realizes it was Boo who saved them. Hey \, Boo she says (362). This is the part of the story that the reader sees how much Boo Radley loves Jem and Scout. When Scout looks out from Boo’s porch \, she glimpses his perspective \, and summarized the events that took place over the summer \, and thinks \, Autumn again \, and Boo’s children needed him (374). Boo cares for these children so much that he considers them his own kids. This is another example of agape \, because he’s giving without expecting anything in return. It’s when Jem and Scout finally realize this that they know they love him back \, which brings them closer together.    We see countless examples of love throughout the book through the characters actions. Martine Luther states that agape is understanding (King 19). The more the characters understand each other \, the more they come to care and love each other. This makes them all \, as a community \, much stronger. It’s a love story \, plain and simple Harper Lee states. Not a romance \, but a book in which agape is shown throughout. This is a book of understanding \, and when there’s understanding \, there is agape. This love is important because this is what human nature needs in order to become united. King and Lee see this importance \, and consider agape a tool used to bring people together to make a stronger community.                        "
10, "Keep On Reading      On the first day of school \, the students walk into the classroom and see a book on every desk. The teachers happily greets them and tells everyone to sit at a desk with a book that seems interesting to them. The pupils tentatively sit down in their seats and look up at their young teacher for instructions \, but she sits down and is soon deeply absorbed in her story \, eyes shimmering in the light. The pupils gaze in wonder at her and slowly crack open their books. We’ve grown up reading \, but not very often do we see a teacher who exemplifies reading. Reading is recurrently a forced activity. Therefore \, people both young and old feel like they HAVE to read \, and so it’s only something they have to do for school or work. They don’t see it as an amazing skill that will not only help with their futures but also a great hobby to enjoy in life. Continuing to silent read for at least the first ten minutes of every class is a very good idea.    The first reason why reading is class is a good idea is because it helps get some of our required silent reading done. Envision Anne \, an active \, sweet young lady who participates in sports and also plays a big part in the school play. The little time she spends at home every day is reserved for homework assignments and memorizing her lines. Time reading in class at school cuts down on the time Anne has to make in order to read. Reading is important to Anne but she knows she can’t possibly read and make good reflections if she doesn’t have the time to do so. Some people just don’t have the time \, so making them read more outside of school is like telling the workers of IBM to go play a football game every day- there’s just not enough time outside of work and school.    There are people who say that silent reading doesn’t help low level readers \, but it reality \, it actually helps a lot. James McNair has many techniques to help children better comprehend what they are reading. He says that children can get bored with reading if it has no meaning to them (i.e. when reading as a class \, not everyone is on the same level \, and therefore \, the lower level readers are not as interested). Once a child discovers the wonders of reading \, they are sure to come across words they don’t know (2). When this happens \, silent reading will surely help because they can go over words they do know \, and learn as they go. This really helps since classwork reading may be harder for lower level readers and they have many words they don’t understand as opposed to learning a couple new words a day. They need practice in order to read better so if students are not surrounded by reading then they will not get better. In a research evaluation by Chow & Chou \, 9th grade students were allowed 10 minutes each day to silent read and improved their reading skills by the end of the year (4). This is solid proof that having time to read in class is a benefit to everyone.    Silent reading is not only fun \, it paves way for tests – no one is allowed to read out loud or have questions read to them during a test. All tests require you to read at least questions. This doesn’t include the rereading you need to do when you write essays for a test \, an example being the NECAPs. Based on the National Center for Educational Statistics of 2008, "reading is one of the few factors that can be the big change in test scores. The more you practice reading \, the more enhanced your vocabulary gets. This helps not only the reading part \, but also the writing parts \, most importantly on standardized tests. Getting students to read in school ensures at least some practice for the testing that the United States schools have for students.    Not only is silent reading useful \, it allows students to choose what they want to read \, which in turn can help their future. Too frequently \, class discussions are based on books that the teacher selects for their students to read. Students may get bored of always having their choices made for them and some even take it for granted and can soon forget how to deal with life on their own. KC \, an avid reader \, agrees: Picking your own books allows you to be more prepared for real life \, not just a classroom where decisions are typically made for you. By having the choice to find their own books \, students become more independent in the process. School prepares them for life \, but their choices prepare them for their future.    Silent reading during school hours has been a widely argued situation in many school districts of the world. We should continue to have silent reading for at least ten minutes every day \, especially because of Winooski High School’s Tier 1 situation. Our school officials say that our NECAP scores are getting lower and require more structure to help fix it. If that’s the case \, then silent reading could only help raise the scores reading well is a big part of the NECAPs \, not only when we read the essays but also to read the questions that accompany them. Having a good knowledge of reading and reading strategies will help our school and a good start to getting there is through silent reading. "
7, "Dear Teachers \,    I have recently begun learning about the Shut Down Your Screen week. This is a program where kids in school and out of school don't use any electronics for one week. Everyone in your school would participate. This is a way to save the way we think and try something new. My question is \, should we participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week? I think it would be a good idea for many reasons.    First \, I think we should participate because using too much technology affects the way we think and behave. In the article Attached to Technology and Paying a Price by Matt Richtel  it gives many scientifically proven facts that using technology too much affects the way we think. If you are juggling e-mail \, phone calls and other incoming information it can lose people’s focus. Also as the text states \, The stimulation provokes excitement that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence \, people feel bored. This means that people can become addicted and when not using technology become bored with things they used to love to do.    Another reason I think we should participate in this program is because using technology while doing something else (multitasking) really just creates more trouble focusing. Scientists did an experiment where they took someone that multitasks and someone that doesn’t. It was proven that even though the multitasker multitasks more \, they did a worse job than the other person. Therefore technology and multi-tasking does nothing for you.    Another reason I think we should participate is it puts a bad toll on children. Some people may say that playing a video game or watching a movie with your family helps to bond with family. That may be true \, but you can get addicted and not want to do anything else. Lily \, a second grader \, is allowed only an hour a day of unstructured time \, which she often spends with her devices. This shows that kids are playing on devices and not outside or with friends. If we participate \, we \, the kids \, can do other things and be more social.    Therefore \, I think we should participate in the  Shut Down Your Screen Week.  Thank you for your time.        Sincerely \,  "

2, "Parts of a Plant How are the parts of a plant important? Here are some ways the parts of a plant are important. One way is that the roots suck nutrients from the soil so the plants can grow. Roots also secure the plant in the ground so it doesn’t blow away. Another important part is the flowers. Seeds are kept in flowers \, and the flower keeps the seeds safe. Stems are also important. They carry nutrients through the plant. Leaves are also important. Leaves collect sunlight for food for the plant. And \, last but not least \, are the seeds. When a seed gets in the ground \, the plant's life begins. Those are some things that show how the parts of a plant are important."

We need water to drink \, wash clothes \, bathe \, and much more \, so we need to save water. One good way to save water is to leave buckets outside to fill up with rain. Take quick showers. Baths take at least 37 gallons of water. Remind people to turn off the water when not in use. Lots of people wait for the water from their sinks to get hot and cold. Put a bucket in your sink. When the bucket is full \, you can use that water for lots of things. When it’s winter \, take buckets of snow and melt it. Then you have buckets of water to use. When it’s summer \, if you have a squirt gun \, use water from a toy that has water in it. If there’s anything leaking water \, make sure to get it fixed right away. Don’t buy water in a plastic container because plastic pollutes the Earth. Please save water."

An organization called Heifer International gave Beatrice’s family a goat named Mugisa and she got everything she needed.      Before Mugisa came Beatrice’s family did not have healthy food Mugisa gave her milk to drink so the family was much healthier. Before Mugisa came Beatrice had to work and still had little money. Mugisa gave them milk to sell. Now  her family has money to buy the tings they need. She even got money to buy a uniform and a slate. Now she can get an education!

3, "Squids    There are many kinds of squids. The giant deep-sea squid can be longer than a city bus \, and they are cousins of the octopus. A squid has a long body and ten arms. They live in the Caribbean. The Squid protects itself by hiding.  A Squid can squirt out a blob of inky stuff. The inky blob may confuse hungry creatures. Its eggs come in handy because it surrounds itself with eggs and protects itself that way. Isn’t this amazing that it can be camouflaged in one second? They hide by moving with  jet propulsion. If a shark tries to attack a squid \, it will shoot out ink so it confuses the shark and zips away. Remember about the eggs? This is something like it. They swim together to protect themselves. They squirt out dark liquid to hide themselves from enemies. They change their colors and patterns to blend in with their surroundings.   Therefore you can see that the squid have many ways of hiding.  "
3, "The Abenaki  The Abenaki lived in Vermont in the early 1600s. The Abenaki are a group of native people. They lived here much before you and me. They learned how to deal with the land. There were no houses \, no electricity \, not even heating. The land had hills \, mountains \, lots of trees \, and rivers. Vermont’s land affected the early Abenaki’s housing and their food.    Vermont’s land affected the Abenaki’s housing. The Abenaki used young trees to build their houses. They cut them down and then bent them into a round roof. This kept the Abenaki warm in the winter because the roof kept the warmth in. Vermont’s land also had lots of animals. They skinned the animals and took their sinews. The sinews held the saplings together. This helped the Abenaki people keep their houses stable. Vermont’s land also had lots of trees. They used the bark from the trees to tie on the frame like shingles. That helped the Abenaki keep the rain out \, so they stayed dry all the time. The Abenaki’s housing was greatly affected by the land.    Not only does the land affect the Abenaki’s housing \, but it also affected the Abenaki’s food \, too. The Abenaki women picked seeds in the forest. Then they planted them in some fresh soil. This helped the Abenaki because they had their own gardens \, and they planted seeds \, and soon they had food. Vermont’s land also had a lot of fish. They killed the fish \, and the dead fish helped fertilize the soil. That gave the Abenaki extra food. Vermont’s land also had abundant wildlife. The Abenaki fished and hunted game. All of the fresh meat was shared among the whole village to keep everybody strong. The Abenaki’s food supply was affected by the land.    Vermont’s land affected the early Abenaki’s housing and their food. The land seems to be a tough place to live \, but the Abenaki respected the land and only took what they needed \, and the land gave them what they needed.    "
4, "Conserving water is a great way to help the Earth. Plants \, humans \, and animals would not be able to live without our water. We need to save water because we will eventually run out of it. Then we will have to use and drink salt water. It is extremely expensive to filter salt water. This is why we need save water. What can you do to save water?    One way you can save water is by getting a rain barrel. Rain barrels collect water so that you can water your plants with recycled water. Recycled water is better for plants because it is more natural. Recycled water also has good nutrients.    Another way you can save water is by getting an aerating faucet and showerhead. These items use less water but make it feel the same because they have more pressure. One more way you can save water is to make sure sprinklers are placed where they are watering the lawn in the summer.    One way my family saves water is by turning off the water when we brush our teeth. Water is the most important natural resource of all. Without water \, we would die. If we ran out of water \, as I said \, we would die. So if you think dying is bad \, try to conserve water as best you can.         "

There are many ways to save water. You can do things outside and inside to help save water. Here are some ideas.    There are many things to do inside your house to help save water. You can change your toilet \, faucet \, and showerhead to low flow. Also \, you can take small \, short showers instead of baths. You can turn off the faucet when brushing your teeth and when lathering soap in your hands. When waiting for water to warm up \, save the water and reuse. Over all \, there are a lot of things you can do inside to save your home’s water.    There are many things to do outside your house to help save water. First you can go to an automated carwash or use a waterless car wash. When you do a car wash at home \, you waste more water. Also you can dump out your water bottle on plants and grass instead of dumping it down the drain. Reuse water outside as much as possible. You can also put a bucket of water outside to catch rainwater and use for watering plants or grass. Overall \, there are a lot of ways to save water outside of your house.    There are many ways to save your home’s water outside and inside. Kids and adults can make a big difference in saving water. Imagine if everyone in the country turned off the faucet when brushing their teeth. We could save enough water to refill a lake!

5, "What Claudette Colvin Did  Learn about how Claudette Colvin helped the civil rights movement. Though most people don’t know it \, Rosa Parks was not the first black person to refuse to give up her seat. Claudette Colvin refused nine months before Rosa \, in 1955. It was during segregation \, and you would get arrested if you didn’t let a white person sit down on a crowded bus while you stood. Segregation happened at lunch counters \, in schools—almost everywhere down south...  Claudette Colvin was important because she stood up for what she knew was right \, and she motivated others. Who was Claudette?      She was a fifteen-year-old black girl. She went to Booker T. Washington High in Montgomery \, Alabama. Her family was very poor \, and her parents tried not to be noticed by white people because they didn’t want to be arrested—the almost opposite of Martin Luther King Jr. She was a smart girl and hated segregation \, especially the bus laws \, because her family had no car and she had to sit in the back. She really wanted to be able to sit in the front of—or anywhere in—the bus. You can tell that Claudette wanted to do something about the bus laws. What did she do? One thing she did was she refused to give up her seat. The law in Montgomery was that you had to give your seat up to a white person if there was no space for him or her. Claudette was still fifteen. One day \, she was tired of having to get up \, so she just stayed in her seat. The bus driver yelled at her \, and soon police came and arrested her as she was kicking and screaming. She was very brave to stand up to the police. An NAACP lawyer named Fred Grey decided to go to the city’s federal court to say that segregation laws were unconstitutional. He tried to find people who would go and talk about how the bus laws were unfair. Most people who had been mistreated were too scared of what might happen to their families. Only four blacks came to the hearing: Claudette and three older women. Claudette was very brave to go to court even though she knew the consequences. Whom did she motivate?      Nine months after Claudette’s arrest \, Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat as well. On Monday \, December fifth \, Martin Luther King and other black leaders had black elementary and high schools pass out thirty-five thousand fliers saying Stay off the buses! That was the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Though Claudette was not the reason for the bus boycott \, she made black leaders realize that they needed to do the same thing \, only using someone more experienced.      Why didn’t black leaders use her? Though Claudette did refuse before Mrs. Parks \, black leaders didn’t want to start a bus boycott just because of a teenager. Also \, she was hard to deal with because she swore a lot when the police took her off the bus \, and black leaders didn’t want that to happen in court or anything. The fact that she was poor didn’t help either \, and Claudette thought they didn’t use her because she and her parents weren’t part of the inner circle \, a group of more wealthy black people. The court case she went to is not very well known \, so she is not recognized that way. Big history books don’t even have a footnote about her. While she is not well known \, she was still important to the civil rights movement.  e 1    Page 1      In conclusion \, Claudette Colvin did what was right and motivated people. She was a big help to the civil rights movement because she motivated Rosa Parks and the black leaders to start the bus boycott. She helped when she went to the hearing because it ended segregation on buses. As Claudette said \, Enough is enough! and at the time that was very true.     "
5, "Letters From Rifka Have you ever been determined to do something? In the book \, Letters From Rifka \, the main character was determined to leave the Ukraine to get to America. Rifka \, a 12 year old girl \, is forced to leave Russia because \, if she doesn’t \, she will be killed. Along the way she is determined \, and that determination helps her to get to America. Rifka never gave up hope. In other words she had indomitable spirit.    In the beginning \, at the Polish border when Rifka got off the train \, the guards force her and her family to take off their clothes for the Doctor. They did this because the Doctor wanted to see if she had a disease. Her determination enabled her to stand there naked \, even though it was an uncomfortable \, humiliating situation.    Another time was when she was on the ship to America \, she nearly drowns and loses a friend when a tempest hit. She goes into the hold which really smells. After the storm ends she looks for her friend \, Peter \, and learns that he has been lost at sea during the storm. Rifka returns to her cabin in tears. A few hours later \, when she hears people ooing and ahhing up on deck as the Statue of Liberty comes into sight she realizes she still wants to go to America. Her determination gave her the power to endure the emotions she had \, and then gave her strength to carry on without her friend.    Another example is when Rifka  is in the hospital wing at Ellis Island. A doctor asks Rifka to take off her kerchief so he can check her for ringworm. Rifka realizes that if he finds something wrong with her she can be sent back to  Ukraine. She was so determined to get to America that she stood up to an American doctor. Other people that didn’t have as much determination might not have done that because they would be too frightened to stand up to someone who could  send them back to their old country.    So as you can see \, determination can get you anywhere. It got Rifka to America. How? It gave her the strength to carry on even though the obstacles were hard to overcome. Determination can help you achieve your goals too."
6, "Effects of The Great Depression    The Great Depression affected the people that lived through it in many ways. The things at I am going to explain are some of the things that affected the people who lived through the Great Depression. Having barely any money was one of the things that affected them. Also having less supplies affected them too. Having to take care of kids too also might have affected the people during the Great Depression.    First \, I am going to talk about how having almost no money affected the people. It affected them because they were getting their money by working. Then their jobs were shutting down so their amount of money was shrinking and shrinking. They would do neighborhood favors and jobs but the amount of money they would get was five dollors. They also had to pay a bill for electricity every month. They had to pay for gas if you had a car and their house. That is why having almost no money affected them a lot.     Another reason the Great Depression affected the people was they were having less of the supplies they had. Like some of the people stopped delivery for several things such as milk and ice. They were also using less electricity and selling their cars. Those are some of supplies they had a shortage or had to not use as much.     Also if they had kids they would need to do extra work and be able to care for them. They also had to pay more money if they had kids because they have to feed them too. They also had to take care of them. The parents have to care for them. If they are sick they can not just leave them at home they have to take care of them. They also might worry about them. If you had kids during the Great Depression not only would you worry about your kids and family. That is why if you had kids during the Great Depression it might be more difficult.     Now you can see how living through the Great Depression was very difficult and affected many people who lived through it. It affected people in many ways like having no money or having a very little amount of it. Also if you had kids it might have been a little more difficult. They also had to live with less supplies. That is why I think the Great Depression affected the people who lived through it."
7, "Living Through The Great Depression    The Great Depression affected many people especially those who lived through it. With that said the main point of this essay is how people who lived through the Depression were affected during it.    During The Great Depression people had things to deal with that made them struggle. Some people didn't have an abundant amount of money not a decent amount. Insted they had little or none at all. It was a struggle to earn money with the lack of jobs \, people ended up doing side jobs to earn money. In Digging In the family of four had to find ways to obtain money. They ended up cutting back on a lot of things like the water system and starting useing their well. The father did his best to get some type of income by doing side jobs \, like cutting the boys hair for ___. People also looked to Rosevelt for help or  farming for a decent or better income. For instance in the poem Debts The family owned land that they used for farming. The father grew weat three years ago and hasn't been able to since. With scarce rain no wheat grew \, without wheat to harvest no money would flow in. Bay \, the father \, even thought about getting a loan from Mr. Roosevelt \, and he promised he didn't have to pay a dime 'till the crop came in. All he could do was hope things got better. Not only did people have things to worry about the President did too. In the artical The New Deal Rosevelt wanted to find a way to help the people suffering from the Great Depression. He created several ways to help with some of the issues. He made the NIRA and NRA \, these systems banned child labor and adress unemployment by regulating the number of hours worked per week. The FERA gave $3 billion to states for work relief programs. In the end these systems only helped people take care of their basic needs.    The people who lived through the Great Depression had to find ways to obtain income \, work and help. The Government did their best to support the people through this time but have you ever thought that this might happen again."
7, "Jean Baptiste de Lamarck and Charles Darwin were both naturalists that had theories about organisms getting helpful variations. Lamarck’s theory was called the theory of acquired characteristics and Darwin’s was called the theory of evolution by natural selection. Lamarck and Darwin’s theories are the same and different in some ways.    Darwin and Lamarck’s theories were very different. Darwin theory said that organisms get helpful variation before changes in the environment. He thought they got the variation by chance at birth. He explained that the reason giraffes had long necks was because some giraffes had a variation which was a longer neck. The giraffes with short necks could only get food on the ground so they had to compete for it so they died. The giraffes with the long necks did not have to compete because they could get the food up high and they survived and passed the long necks onto their young.  Lamarck theory said that organisms got helpful variation after  a change in the environment. He said that giraffes got long necks when the food on the ground ran out. The giraffes needed to eat food and there was food up high so they stretched out their necks. They then passed it on to their young. Their theories are different because Lamarck thought that organisms changed out of need and after a change in the environment and Darwin thought organisms changed by chance when they were born and before there was a change in the environment.    Darwin and Lamarck’s theories were very different but they were also very similar. They both thought that organisms changed. They thought these changes could be very useful and could help them survive. The changes could then get passed down to the young. That is how Lamarck and Darwin’s theories are similar.    Lamarck and Darwin’s theories are both the same and different in some ways.  "
7, "To Build a Fire    One of the most important things in life is to know how to build a successful fire. For ages fire has been a critical part of our lives. Fire provides heat \, and this is what it is mainly used for. Heat cooks food. This is also critical because some uncooked foods can cause some very nasty \, unmentionable diseases. And \, of course \, there is aesthetics. Could one be more cheerful than roasting chesnuts over an open fire?    So \, now that you’re all convinced that fire is the greatest thing in the world \, you probably should know how to make a successful fire. Well \, I agree wholeheartedly to teaching you. So \, let us go through the steps one by one.     First you need to decide where you are going to build the fire \, whether it be in a woodstove \, in a fireplace \, or out in the open. They are all relatively the same in terms of process \, but materials used can differ. The basic process is as follows.    First you need to find some newspaper \, or other easily burnt materials such as birch bark \, office papers \, old report cards \, etc. Crumple up enough of the paper to cover the bottom of your fire area (if you are using birch bark just lay a few strips down). Next you need kindling. Kindling usually is best in the form of split boards \, but split wood is also fine as long as the wood is dry and not green (not in color but if wood has been cut recently it is usually referred to as green). About four to eight pieces should be laid on top of the paper in a criss-cross design in order to allow the fire air. See Figure 1. Note: Fire will not burn without oxygen! Do not smother it!  Then you need a small piece of firewood \, preferably not green. This should be laid diagonally across the top of the kindling.    Well \, that’s the hard part. Now you just need a match. Light the paper (or bark) in a few places and watch the fire blaze. Note: The wood will need to be replenished now and then. Just lay a piece of firewood across the top of the currently burning log and it will soon start blazing Enjoy your wonderful fire wherever you are!    I hope that if you survive your first fire you will continue to use this wonderful power of nature safely so that all can enjoy it. And remember \, ‘only YOU can prevent forest fires!’  "
8, "Dignity and Hope    The Great Depression. This notorious event put America's hope to the test \, leaving Americans economically and mentally drained. The Great Depression devastated America and will never be forgotten. If not for Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his beneficial New Deal \, who knows what horrid ruins would remain as a result of The Great Depression?     With no dependable income \, we cut back on everything possible. This excerpt from the story Digging In by Robert J. Hastings shows the situation that each and every American faced. In the story \, it is said that the family substituted toothpaste and toilet paper for soda and catalog pages. Even common necessities had to be sacrificed during the Great Depression.    Along with their wallets \, Americans' spirits were also crushed. In the poem Debts by Karen Hesse \, the father of the family faces a serious drought but still believes in rain. When reality sets in that rain is not likely to come \, he is filled with rage and leaves to *** to the farm to avoid feuding with his pregnant wife. This man was a farmer and had to rely on the most unreliable thing for a source of income \, Mother Nature. This man and every other American's spirits were tested during the Great Depression \, and the number of those who still had hope was constantly diminishing. With America facing economic doom \, Americans turned to one man - Franklin Delano Roosevelt. With the promise of a New Deal to help end the Great Depression \, Roosevelt won the election by a landslide. He created jobs for three million single men between seventeen and twenty-three years of age. Roosevelt's work relief program put eight and a half million Americans to work building roads \, bridges \, airports and more. Although Roosevelt did not end the Great Depression \, he provided Americans with work and hope.     The Great Depression left Americans mentally as well as economically depleted. This event tested the will of the American people and left some citizens without any hope. With the help of Franklin Delano Roosevelt \, America was able to get through the Great Depression with dignity and hope.       "
8, "How Mount Olympus is Like a Cell    Have you ever looked at your own cells? No \, of course not. You’re a mortal and you don’t have the power or technology to do that. Maybe some day in the future we shall grant humans the power of microscopic vision. Who knows? That’s up to Zeus. Cells are amazing things. Each one is individually different. When I first looked at my own cells I thought \, WOW there is nothing like this in the whole world. I was wrong. Recently \, I came to the realization that my own dear Mount Olympus is very much like a cell itself. There are many components in a cells that can also \, in a way \, be found on Mount Olympus. The structure of a cell and the components within are very like Mount Olympus. What? You don’t believe me? Well fine! Come on. I’ll show you. Oh \, and by the way my name is Eos and I’m the Greek goddess of dawn. I’m responsible for the rising of the sun. Be careful and follow me. Don’t let anyone else see you. Mortals aren’t allowed up her. Let’s go.    In an animal cell \, the cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell. There are small pores that allow things of different sizes through. Up her \, on Olympus what keeps the mortals from entering. or leaving (if they are to be kept here) is an instilled fear of us. Mortals dare not enter unless told to by one of the gods or goddesses. They dare not leave either.    Now \, all of you stand still. No \, it’s okay. This is just a powder that will make you invisible. Nobody move or make a sound. Got it? If you do \, it will be your life wasted. I just have to check to make sure that neither Zeus or Hera are in their throne room…Okay \, we can go in. Just go silently and quickly! This is Zeus and Hera’s throne room \, which is very similar to the nucleus of a cell. In a cell \, the nucleus is the control center of activity on a cellular level. It’s from here that Zeus and Hera control the happenings of immortals and mortals alike. It’s like the control center for the world.    Holy Zeus! Someone’s coming in. It’s Zeus himself! Quick into here. No noise \, no movement \, no nothing! Those of you who can peer through the window \, do so. You’ll be able to see the head god himself! Zeus and his wife \, Hera \, control the gods \, goddesses \, and mortals. They are like the chromosomes in a cell. In a cell \, the chromosomes determine what kind of cell it will be and how it acts. That is what Zeus and Hera do in the world.  In a cell \, the ribosomes turn amino acids into proteins. On Mount Olympus we make many things like laws \, rules \, and the weather. However \, the most material thing that we make are lightning bolts. Of course \, only Zeus can actually make them. Although others can use them if they have his permission. See how Zeus only uses his left hand for tasks? That is because his right hand is used to make lightening. Like the ribosomes \, his hand takes raw materials (the abundant plasma and energy up here) and creates a whole new product (lightning.) His hand is like a the ribosomes in a cell.    Good \, Zeus is leaving. This closet is starting to get stuffy. We should go quickly out into the hall. Now take a right \, then a left into here. This is the courtyard. Immortals don’t have to eat \, but we do it for the pleasure of it. Also \, eating helps keep us healthy and happy. The fountains flow with sweet juices and wines. The trees have the best fruits possible. That table over there is always supplied with the most delectable food imaginable.  Those chests that are spread around are filled with gold and jewels for our taking. Wearing these helps enhance our godly image. This courtyard represents the vacuoles in a cell. In the vacuoles \, large amounts of what the cell needs are stored. Here large amounts of what immortals thrive on is stored.  Don’t be alarmed. Those are our mortal slaves. They won’t tell on us because I have ordered them not to. In an animal cell \, mitochondria store energy and release it when necessary. They power the cell. Here on Mount Olympus \, we could not get by with out thee slaves. They perform almost every task that can even slight be considered laborious. The energy they get from food is stored in their bodies and released in order to do tasks.  In a cell \, the ER \, or endoplasmic reticulum \, help to move substances around the cell. The halls and paths we’ve been following are very similar to the ER \, they are like the roads that contain all movement.  Quick \, into this room here. That was Hermes the messenger god. Now that I think of it \, he is very much like the golgi bodies in a cell. The golgi bodies package and ship substances from place to place in a cell. Hermes \, similarly wraps items up in goat skin and takes them from one person \, immortal \, or Titan to another.  Now \, let’s go back to the entrance. You should go. Soon every god \, goddess \, demi-god \, and demi-goddess will be coming. There is a big meeting tonight. So they were all summoned here. By now \, I’m sure you can see how Mount Olympus is structured like a cell Just follow that path down there until you get home. Wait \, the day is almost over and it’ll get dark. Each of you swallow some of this powder. There \, this enables you to fly \, which is much faster than walking. If you promise not to tell anyone about this and you can go. You swear? Okay \, good bye.   "
9, "Gains of the Great Depression    During the Great Depression \, millions of people lost jobs \, and families struggled to find financial footholds. It lasted for ten years \, leaving very strong memories of dramatically dark times. Throughout those years \, people found new ways to cope with the struggles \, and interestingly enough \, new emotions and belief in the ideals of America. Everybody learned the importance of being resourceful \, while also keeping hope for the future and growing more unified and patriotic as a country.    One important effect of the Great Depression was how it made people and families resourceful. That quality is largely a part of the memoir Digging In \, where a man who lived during the Depression talked about his family's frugalness \, and how they had to cut back on everything possible in order to save money. Some of the things they had to cut back on included city water \, selling their car \, and discontinuing purchases of toothpaste \, toilet paper \, and snacks \, just to name a few. They also took care of what [they] had \, and listed all the ways they used a cotton cloth \, which included using it as a dish cloth \, bandage \, quilt piece and more. These qualities of being frugal and resourceful weren't bad; they taught people to not be wasteful and to not spend money on things that aren't necessary. Being resourceful became a part of life during the Depression as a way to help families stay financially afloat.    More significantly the Great Depression \, in a broad sense \, brought a sense of patriotism and more unity as a country. Former President Franklin D. Roosevelt enriched his second inaugural address with these ideals. He said that the greatest change he had witnessed was the change in the moral climate of America and that they were on the road of progress. Another quote of his was in seeking for economic and political progress as a nation \, we all go up \, or else we all go down \, as one people. What Roosevelt was implying was if the people wanted their country to go in the right direction \, they all had to work together. Working together wouldn't be hard \, due to the entire country's new sense of belief in their country \, also known as patriotism. The United States' stronger sense of unity that came about during the depression helped citizens work through the hard times.     Most importantly \, the Depression oddly enough brought a sense of hope. In some cases \, farmers had to keep hope for the future and that it would bring rain for their crops so they could get money \, as a farmer had in a poem called Debts. In an article about The New Deal \, on explanation was given about how Roosevelt gave the country hope by creating many reforms that were aimed to relieve poverty \, reduce unemployment \, and speed economic recovery. This hope for the future gave people something worth living for during times when suicide didn't seem like a bad idea. Indeed \, this sense of hope was a very important effect that the Great Depression had on the people who lived through it.    Even though the Depression devastatingly affected tens of millions of people \, the way it changed people's outlooks was inspiring. Instead of tossing a cotton bag in the garbage \, people learned to be resourceful and used them as towels and dish cloths. A stronger sense of pride in their country helped them work through the hardships together \, with patriotism and unity. Above all else \, without hope for the future \, people would've given up on trying to fix their severely wounded economy. These enhanced senses of resourcefulness \, unity \, along with patriotism and hope were all ways that the Great Depression affected Americans.     "
9, "The Secret Communication of Wolves    A long piercing howl shatters the quiet night of a northern forest.  The howl grows into a chorus of yelps and barks \, and the valley echos to the chilling sound.  The leader of the pack starts the noise \, while other pack members \, as well as other wolf packs \, join in (O’Toole 22).    Among wolves \, communication is a very highly developed skill.  For instance \, the howl of the pack leader has many different meanings.  Most of the time a lone howl is a warning for other packs.  It tells them to stay away \, for there are many young to be protected and food to be guarded (O’Toole 23).  A howl can also be a way of marking their territory.  Many wolves howl when they feel another pack is too close.  Some wolves howl when they are lost or trying to find another member of the pack.  Most wolves use this howl at least once a day to locate missing pups or other pack members (Primate).    To wolves \, the territory that they occupy (the territory of some packs may cover 20-120 square miles) is like a house to a human being. They feel that they must protect it all times \, and \, other packs must not trespass.  Neighboring packs may share up to a mile of territory \, but rarely will they share more than that (Primate).  All wolves know that if they run through another pack’s territory \, they run the risk of being killed (Primate).  In addition \, wolves mark their territory by scent (mostly urine).  This helps all wolves know where their territory begins.    Like humans \, the wolf has three main avenues of communication \, postural (body language); vocal (the howl or snarl); and olfactory (scent) (Wolfhaven).  The scent is the most commonly used \, and probably the most important.  Besides marking territory \, it helps show food ownership \, as well as acting as a road map for themselves.  Wolves also have scent glands between their toes \, which leaves their scent wherever they go (Primate).      Moreover \, much communication is done through body language.  Many postures have been evolved to reduce conflict and aggression among pack members.  Facial expressions are the most obvious.  Generally \, bared teeth with ears erect and pointed back can indicate a threat by a dominant male (Wolfhaven).  In contrast \, a closed mouth \, slitlike eyes \, and ears pulled forward (and close to their head) will most likely indicate subordinate behavior (Wolfhaven).  Wolves also use their tail position to communicate emotion.  Threatening wolves hold their tails high \, almost perpendicular \, while more submissive wolves lower themselves before dominant pack members.  These lower class members often have their tails tucked between their legs (Primate).  A wolf that has been defeated in a fight can avoid being attacked by its victorious companion by taking a posture similar to that of a pup begging for food (University of Oklahoma Press 91).    Wolves must communicate at all times when they are hunting.  They have to work together to catch most of their food (due to the size of the food that they hunt).  The concept that wolves use is called the Pincer Attack (Baily 91).  When using the pincer attack \, the pack splits in two groups and surround the prey (mostly deer \, sheep \, and other medium-sized mammals).  One of the groups causes a diversion \, while the other half ambushes the helpless prey.  Wolves can move quickly and quietly.  Many of them operate on stamina rather then on sudden bursts of speed (Baily 85).  Because of the cooperation of the group \, when it comes to hunting \, the pack usually ends up victorious \, and they have enough food for a couple of days.  If they pack gets a big kill \, then the leader will have the next strongest male guard the kill during the night to keep off other animals.    Like other animals \, wolves communicate with a social ladder.  They have one dominant male (usually the leader of the pack) (Primate).  This wolf has many responsibilities.  He has to make sure that all the other wolves don’t get out of line \, and makes sure that there is harmony among the group.  The pack leader does this by barking at the other wolves and fighting with the other males.  Normally \, the pack leader will not fight with the females of the pack unless it is necessary (Timberwolf).  With the leader comes a dominant female.  Together they are known as the breeding  pair.  These two are in charge of the pack \, raising the young \, selecting denning areas and rendezvous sites \, capturing food \, and maintaining the pack’s territory (Primate).  These two wolves are also responsible for the offspring.  Not many of the other wolves mate for offspring because that is the dominant pair’s job.  Every year the dominant pair will produce one litter of pups.  These pups take the place of the older wolves that are too old to hunt.  Because the pack is so close and they communicate all the time \, many of the other female wolves help the dominant female with taking care of the young (Wolfhaven).  The dominant female will assign each pup to an older female.  This helps the other females learn how to be a mother \, and it helps the dominant female so she can hunt and not have to worry about taking care of her young.    If only humans could communicate as well as wolves \, today’s society would be wonderful.  Wolves’ methods of communication are simple and usually resolve conflicts without violence.  Wolves have been living together for many \, many years so they must  be doing something right.  Maybe we can learn something from the wolves instead of trying to make them extinct.  "
11, "Hope During The Great Depression    Life is difficult. Sometimes \, it is devastatingly so. Yet the human race can be defined by the dual characteristics of perseverance and hope. We \, the human race \, are the infamous turtle of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath \, we take each obstacle in stride and keep on going on. The Great Depression is one of the best examples of humankind's tendency towards both perseverance and hope. The fact that so many people managed to live through the terrible poverty of the Great Depression is a testament to the tenacity of hope and optimism in humans \, and Americans in particular.    The texts provided for this analysis all discuss the Great Depression and its effects on the people who lived through it. On the whole \, the theme translated from the texts is that the people who survived the Great Depression developed \, as a direct result of the Depression \, a curiously strong sense of optimism. President Franklin D. Roosevelt \, in his Second Inaugural Address \, attributes this sense of optimism to democracy \, and its ...innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable \, to solve problems once considered unsolvable. Roosevelt is \, of course \, making a blunt reference to his popular and effective programs under the New Deal. It is true that the New Deal had come at just the right moment \, and that millions of people were helped through the New Deal \, particularly the WPA \, or Works Progress Administration \, which was \, as put in the fourth source from PBS \, a major work relief program...[employing] more than 8.5 million people to build bridges \, roads \, public buildings \, parks and airports. 8.5 million people is a lot of people to employ \, and based upon these facts alone it would seem that the New Deal was indeed reason to hope.    Yet the other sources \, and indeed even later on in Roosevelt's speech \, indicate that such hope was perhaps misplaced \, at least in the extent that the hope was placed upon Roosevelt. In Digging In \, the second source written by Robert J. Hastings \, the narrator reflects on her father's efforts to get money: it was a day's work here and a day's work there...a few days on the WPA... Thus \, it seems that although the WPA may have employed 8.5 million people \, it was not by any means a source of income \, if people were only able to work for a few days at a time. However \, the focus of Digging In is not to evaluate federal programs \, but to evaluate the effectiveness of one's own efforts to help oneself. More than anything \, the lengths to which the narrator's family went in order to save money exemplifies \, once again \, an incredible amount of perseverance. From the selling of the car \, to the renouncement of milk and ice \, the family maintains their perseverance and their hope. Towards the end of the passage \, the narrator's mother speaks of this imperative hope: I've learned that whatever happens \, your Daddy always has a little dab of money put back somewhere... Whether or not this was true \, it certainly seems to be a sentiment that enabled the family to maintain their sanity     In Roosevelt's speech \, there is a section in which he employs anaphora to give emphasis to the negative effects of the Depression by repeating \, for several lines \, I see... followed by a sad image \, thought \, or idea. He finishes the anaphora with I see one-third of a nation ill-housed \, ill-clad \, ill-nourished. While this rhetorical emphasis is used mainly to lead into his positive images to follow \, in order to be more convincing towards his audience \, the negative scenes which he describes were not only rhetorical \, but quite real. People were homeless and clotheless and foodless during the Great Depression \, millions of them. That is why it is so incredible that the primary effect of such a tragedy was to create a generation of hopeful people. Such hope is characterized in the first source \, a poem by Karen Hesse entitled Debts. In this poem \, the narrator describes that Daddy is thinking/ of taking a loan from Mr. Roosevelt and his men... This connection to the New Deal emphasizes that the government \, through President Roosevelt \, helped instigate the massive flood of hope in the American people. The dad in the poem wants to buy wheat even though such an idea is completely impractical; the dad is a naively hopeful character.    As the Ma says in the last phrase of the poem \, well \, it rains enough...to keep a person hoping./But even if it didn't/your daddy would have to believe. This quote defines succinctly the mind-set amongst Americans living in the Depression that hope will lead to greatness. Perhaps this was because Americans could do nothing else but hope \, and work \, and trust in the leaders of their country. It is human nature \, after all \, to do everything one can to keep oneself going. Thus \, the Depression imprinted a sense of hope on the people that lived through it. It is a sense of hope that has not been witnessed to the same extent in our time \, yet hope continues to persevere in humans.   "
12, "McValues    Looking at this ad \, who would guess that those golden arches bring home approximately fourteen billion dollars a year customers worldwide? Who would guess that McDonald’s is the world’s leading food organization and employs over 28,000 workers in 120 different countries? The ad is \, in fact \, an image of a completely different nature. It is a calm \, nostalgic looking ad; nothing in the peaceful summer scene hints that McDonald’s has or ever will represent anything other than quality family living.    The characters in the ad are strategically positioned to inspire within the viewer \, feelings of fun and familiarity. The picture located at the center of the page \, depicts an older woman with a little girl—perhaps her granddaughter—beside her. The two are lying on their stomachs \, propped up by elbows in the sand. Neither looks up as the camera clicks \, catching them at play. The little girl giggles as her tiger toy leaps over the walls of her castle made of sand. Her grandmother looks on with a knowing smile \, perhaps remembering the days when she used to play such innocent games. The sun shines down on their backs and speckles the older woman’s face through her woven sunhat. Behind \, their legs are crossed at the ankles in carefree swing—the girl in imitation of her clearly admirable grandmother. They have obviously been to this beach before \, and are having the time of their lives.    As with the characters \, the placement of the props in the ad is very significant. The slightly unfocused images of the beach gear on their right are clearly placed as a backdrop \, almost as a side note—not directly related to the McDonald’s message about family values \, but still essential. The responsible grandmother planned ahead and brought along all they might need for a day on the beach \, but does not need to broadcast it to the viewer. In the far corner \, an umbrella stands shading their picnic blanket; beside the grandmother’s arm is a pair of sunglasses \, and upon her head rests a hat to protect her from the sun. Oh \, and what’s that in the corner? Ah yes \, the McDonald’s Happy Meal they picked up on their way. Cheeseburgers with french-fries is far from the healthiest picnic Grandma could have brought for her granddaughter \, but what does that matter? They’re spending time together.    The summer scene in black and white instantly creates a feeling of nostalgia. It is a time warp of sorts \, to the safety of the1950s when family values were still a part of American society. It jumps back to simpler days when children did as they were told and a day on the beach with family was an acceptable way to spend the weekend—the good old days when all was well with the world.    The busy parents of today can be assured that McDonald’s is just as wholesome and just as capable of creating memories as their mothers’ picnics were in the 1950s. The first line of print below the picture reads \, Some connections never seem to fade. The statement refers to the family connection that existed for the parents of today when they were young. The message makes it very clear that the dwindling respect for quality family values is kept alive with McDonald’s.    In stark contrast to the quiet shades of gray and the general feeling of calm in the photo \, the McDonald’s logo stands out sharply in the lower corner. Being the only colored object in the ad \, the ketchup and mustard M is impossible to miss. There can be no confusion over whose product is being sold.    The few sentences about \, and the image of \, Pooh corner appeals to the whole family—the parents and their Pooh-loving kids. Above the logo and the scene of contentment \, the page is blank except for one sentence: Suddenly the house on Pooh corner doesn’t seem so far away. This statement \, coupled with the image of the girl recreating Pooh’s world on the beach \, emphasizes the idea that McDonald’s makes dreams come alive. The ad states that Pooh corner doesn’t seem so far away \, and right below it is their proof—a little girl playing in Pooh corner    In the lower right corner \, below the hideously-bold \, trademark M \, the ad makes yet another pitch. In this modern world of work and stress \, McDonald’s kindly asks everyone to smile. In that one \, simple word \, so much more is implied. Slow down \, take a break \, we’re here to help \, be happy \, come to McDonald’s \, we understand.    The entire ad is an attempt to appeal to the parental ideal. Connecting McDonald’s food with an image of family fun provides an equal alternative for busy parents who don’t have room in their lives for quality time with their families. McDonald’s is the world’s largest and fastest growing food chain. It brings in billions of dollars a year \, has thousands of stockholders and represents one of the biggest food monopolies in the world \, but none of that matters in the ad. Life can be good \, and it can be bought at McDonald’s.  "

2, "The Lorax said he cares for the earth. The Lorax spoke for the fish. He said stop putting your left over gunk in the water because the humming fish can’t hum with gunk in their gills. The Lorax spoke for the trees. He said stop cutting the trees because they give us air. The Lorax spoke for the Brown Barbaloots. He said stop cutting trees because the Brown Barbaloots eat the fruit on the tees. The Lorax cares for the earth."

Another reason is some kids will only drink chocolate Milk Another reason is. they Both have the same amount of protein (8 grams) and calcium. protein Gives you energy calcium makes your bones stronger. chocolate Milk is still really healthy even though it has chocolate in it."
3, "Australian Animal adaptations	In the hot desert of Australia there are many animals big and small. Some of those animals are the kangaroo \, the dingo \, and the blue-tongued skink. All of animals in the Australian desert must be well adapted to their hot and dangerous environment. The emu and the thorny devil are well adapted to the Australian desert. The emu in Australian has predators like many other animals. The emus have long legs and can run 50 to 60 mph to get away from predators like the dingo. This is a good adaptation so they don’t get eaten. The emu babies don’t have long legs so they can’t go fast to get away from predators. Instead of going fast they have camouflage and hid in the grass and blend in Camouflage is a very good adaptation. The thorny devil is also very well adapted to the extremely dry desert. Even if there is almost no water the thorny devil won’t die. It won’t die because its horns direct even the smallest bit of rain or morning dew. into its mouth. This is a useful adaptation. Even when there is almost no water it won’t die of thirst. The thorny devil also has adaptations to avoid predators. It looks like the sand so its predators can’t see it. Camouflage is a good adaptation. The Emu and the thorny devil must be well adapted to the harsh environment of the Australian desert. I think the emu and the thorny devil are some of the most interesting animals on earth."
4, "Ecotourism can have bad and good effects. In keeping the balance ecotourism is described as something more complicated then it actually is. Ecotourism is really when tourists go to a country to see its wildlife. Ecotourism can help people understand wildlife but it can also harm it. This is a serious problem but there are some solutions. Ecotourism can really ruin things. If ecotourists disturb wildlife they might wreck the ecosystem. Ecotourism can destroy plants and natural habitats. For example ecotourists might trample plants and/or scare animals and/or leave garbage everywhere. Ecotourist need lodging (Hotels and resorts) and bathrooms. These harm the environment by polluting water and destroying forests which the ecotourists would otherwise be looking at. Generally ecotourism is supposed to focus on personal growth and environmental responsibility \, but mostly it doesn't.	But there is some hope. If everybody puts their heads together we can think up some ways to improve ecotourism \, environmentally. All we really need is a few ideas to spark the brain storm \, so here they are.One thing we could do is just prevent ecotourism altogether. But then people might forget how to value and treat nature respectfully.  Another thing we could do is set some lower limits than there are at the moment for ecotourism.	Something else we could do is decrease the number of ecotourists to a small average. Another good solution is to make pathways and trams and things to keep ecotourists at a distance from wildlife. One more thing we can do to improve ecotourism is to have a class on how to treat the flora and fauna. Those are just 4 things we could to do improve ecotourism.	I think those are all the sparks we need. I hope these sparks light up peoples understanding of ecotourism."
4, "The Gardener  I read a book called The Gardener. It is about a girl named Lydia who goes into the city from the country to help her uncle and help him get money. It takes place during the great depression. In spite of the challenges \, Lydia succeeded in being happy in the city. 	It must have been tough for Lydia to leave the country and go to the city at first. She looked really sad to leave in the pictures and looked like she missed her family and her country life. It must have also been hard for her because the city and country are very different. She might think that she was unwelcome there or that people wouldn’t like her there. Also she wasn’t with her parents so she might miss them too. It is tough to miss your family. When she was in the train station it was dark and scary and she looked tiny and scared. It must not have been very fun for her there at first because everything was dark and scary. Another thing that must not have been very welcoming for her is that her uncle (she is staying with her uncle) never smiles. He always looks grumpy and depressed. It is always more nice to visit a cheerful person rather than a grumpy person. 	Even though there were challenges \, Lydia also succeeded in being happy. There were good things that made up for the bad things. At the beginning \, when she first starts helping her uncle in his bakery \, she makes friends. She met them because they work with her uncle. It is always nice to have friends wherever you go. Also \, it is kind of depressing to not have friends sometimes. Another thing that made lydia happy was that she gardens \, she planted flowers and made her street more happy. Everybody \, (even her uncle \, her uncle is always grumpy) got more cheerful after the flowers. That helped L Everybody \, (even her uncle \, her uncle is always grumpy) got more cheerful after the flowers. That helped Lydia a lot because for one \, she likes planting flowers \, and two \, everybody seemed more happy and that made her have a good feeling. After that \, she realizes the there is a rooftop garden but it is all dead. She plants flowers their with her friend and spruces it up. When it is finished \, she brings her frowning uncle up her secret place and shows him around. He tells her to wait there and then a while later he comes up with a beautiful cake. He uncle doesn’t actually smile but Lydia thinks the cake is worth a thousand smiles. That is important to Lydia because she has been working to make her uncle smile for a long time and \, her uncle is finally happy. 	Now you can see how \, in spite of the challenges \, Lydia succeeded in living happily away from home. And \, even though there are sometimes challenges in life \, there are always good things too."

3, "My Lost Kittens 	One sunny day \, my mom and I took our kittens for a walk around our house. The kittens were very excited because it was their first time. My kittens’ names are Flounder and Aerial. Aerial is a girl and Flounder is a boy with a circle on his side. They are both the colors yellow and white.        	When we took the kittens outside \, we had to be very careful so they would not get loose. Then a car drove by. It scared them and they ran.

4, "Finding Rosalita It was Sunday. My family and I were in France. I was as happy as a bee. We were driving along the road when my daddy stopped the car. He told my brother and sister to get out of the car to see what the furry lump on the side of the road was. They got out of the car. Ten seconds later \, they got back in the car with a very small kitten in their hands. She was about the size of a very \, very \, very \, very small baby bottle. My stomach went into my throat when I saw it actually was a kitten. She was meowing as loud as a foghorn. It was so horrible \, I couldn’t think. Mreow. I felt horrible. I knew that I hadn’t done anything bad to her \, but I just couldn’t help it. She was so cold. I was worried. Her claws were as sharp as sewing needles being pricked into your skin. I shuddered. She had crusts over her eyes \, from infections \, that looked like they hurt.     We were headed into the village. Madame Sanz was there. We asked her what to do. I was afraid that she wouldn’t have any advice. Thankfully \, she told us what to do. She told us to boil rose petals in water till they were warm and wet. Then we should pour them into a bowl with some water and keep on rubbing then over the kitten’s eyes.     After that \, we decided to call the little kitten Rosalita. We also call her other things that sound like Rosalita \, but I won’t mention that. We prayed. Luckily \, she is still with us now. Hopefully \, she will be with us much \, much \, much \, much longer.  "
5, "Queen and The Three Dogs    It’s too bad that Mr. Griff is closing the shop \, Queen thought to herself. Queen and the three dogs had been pets of Mr. Griff \, the owner \, but now the shop was going out of business \, and Mr. Griff put all the furniture outside his shop so people could look at it.  Queen had to hold a meeting with the dogs. They loved the shop \, but they would probably have to go to the pound because Mr. Griff wouldn’t be able to feed them with what little money he had. Queen meowed a couple of times \, and the dogs came bounding over. First Charlie \, then Skip \, and then Spot. Queen climbed up to the top of the velvet chair and got right down to the point. You guys are going to have to leave here or go to the pound. What do you want to do?   We wouldn’t go to the pound for anything \, they chorused.  So I guess you’re leaving \, Queen said. Queen was trying to hold tears back. She loved the dogs \, but she wouldn’t be able to come with them. She had a bad leg \, and whenever she tried to run \, pain would shoot up her leg like a lightning bolt electrocuting someone. Queen would have to go to the pound or be a street cat—an idea she disliked.   Do you boys have all your toys with you?   Yes \, we do.   Are you sure you will be OK without me?  We think so.  Queen followed the boys into the shop so she could hear their barks of goodbye to Mr. Griff. But Mr. Griff was talking to a man. After what seemed like an eternity \, the man left with a grin on his face. Mr. Griff also had a grin on his face. My wonderful pets \, we will be able to stay in the upstairs apartment because that wonderful man bought the shop from us \, but he is letting us stay upstairs still! The dogs jumped for joy \, and even though she couldn’t jump \, Queen started to purr.  "
5, "Frustration 	I dip my fountain pen into the ink container. I place the pen on the paper. What will be the first words of the Declaration of Independence? They must be convincing and also get the message to King George that we want to be free. After waiting for what seems like an hour \, I print the words The Colonists of the new land want to . . . No! That won’t do. The words must be more convincing. I crumble the paper and throw it across the room. I dip the pen again and place the pen on a new \, clean sheet of paper. Now I print the words We hold these truths to be self-evident \, that all men are created equal . . . No! That will go later in the paper \, I scream \, now ripping up the paper. I’m so angry that when I dip my pen \, ink splatters on my white cuff. After an hour \, I decide on the first words: When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds . . . Yes! Those will be the first words of the Declaration of Independence \, I say \, leaping for joy."
5, "Tooth Trouble      Charlie \,  if you don’t like your oatmeal just tell me and I’ll get you some cereal \, Mom said \, looking over the table with a puzzled face.    Her daughter \, Charlie \, short for Charlene \, was chewing her favorite food slowly and carefully \, and she was making a funny face. Charlie’s twin sister \, Tess \, was doing the same thing. We like oatmeal \, but we don’t want to disturb them \, said Tess.    Disturb who? asked Aaron \, their older brother. He shook his curly black hair and looked strangely at Mom. She looked back and shrugged.    Tess and Charlie threw back their tiny \, red copper heads and showed their teeth. They each wiggled one and smiled. Looth tooth \, said Aaron getting up from the table and putting on his backpack.    Looth tooth \, said Tess and Charlie at the same time. They were walking out the door with Aaron to catch the bus. Mom followed them out the door and got into the car to go to work.    Bye \,  kids \, see you after school! called Mom \, backing out of the driveway.    On the bus \, Charlie and Tess decided to tell their best best friend Molly first about their teeth. When they got to school \, they ran into kindergarten room faster than Aaron could run to the eighth grade room. In the classroom \, they met the very person they wanted to see \, Molly Stagburn.    Molly! Molly \, guess what? yelled the twins.    What? said Molly.    We have loose teeth! said the twins with a big smile. A look of horror spread across Molly’s face.    Oh \, no! she said.    My big brother Zack said that when one tooth comes out the rest come out too. He knows everything because  he’s almost in third grade. Tess and Charlie almost cried.    At snack \, they only ate one cracker each \, and at lunch they decided not to eat at all. After lunch \, their teacher \, Mrs. Tellen \, noticed they where looking sort of pale.    Charlie \, Tess \, are you feeling alright?    No \, they replied.    Oh dear \, I suppose I should call your mother \, she sighed and walked over to the phone.    Half an hour later \, the twins found themselves in the back of their mother’s car.  Girls \, I would like you to tell me what made you sick. Was it something you ate? Charlie and Tess looked at each other.    Actually Mom \, we haven’t eaten all day \, said Tess.    But you told me what you wanted. Did you change your minds?    No. but we didn’t want all our teeth to fall out.    What did Aaron tell you this time? Mom asked remembering the time Aaron had told them that if you ate bananas \, monkeys would fly out your ears. It wasn’t Aaron this time. Molly’s brother said that if one tooth comes out \, the others come out too \, said Tess as they pulled into the driveway.    Molly’s brother has a grapenut for a brain. Mom joked.    When they were inside the house \, Mom put them on stools and gave them each apples. Almost immediately \, they forgot about their teeth and ate.    Now you listen to me. All your teeth are not going to fall out. The only way that would happen would be if Aaron punched you hard enough. If that happened \,  I would take you to the dentist to have him look at your teeth \, and I would ground Aaron for 20 years \, Mom said softly. Hey  \, my tooth came out! Mine too! Charlie and Tess yelled together.    See \, I told you Zack was wrong. Next time don’t listen to Molly \, said Mom. Charlie and Tess looked at Mom and smiled. They both had big gaps in their smiles.

6, "Black Mountains of Dust  I was sitting at a park bench when I saw the endless black heading towards me. Mom look! I screamed. My mom turned around and faced me. A look of pure horror was painted across her face.  Margaret come on we need to go now!  She shouted. We ran across roads and dried up cropt fields. We did not dare look back. Suddenly I wasn't running away from the black cloud. Instead I was face down in the dirt. Oh no I had tripped over my shoelace! I slowly looked up where was my mom? The cloud loomed closer and closer. I choked feeling the gritty dust in my throat. I tryed to crawl forward but needles shot through my legs. Oh great in a time like this my legs fall asleep! A whiff of dust blew toward me \, burning my eyes and making everything blury.  Mom! I screamed. Mom!  I tryed to yell again but was choked by more dust. Mom I whined. Where was she. I started coughing from all of the dust in my lungs and throat.   Margaret! Darling come on! My mom motioned me to get up but I shook my head.  My Mom flung me into her arms and ran \, soaring farther away from the storm. After what seemed forever \, my mom stopped running. Screams and yells echoed off walls. I covered my ears.    A person right in front of us said:     Get inside quickly!  My mom answered okay and then I was carried into a building \, that looked like the town hall.   My mom set me down n a corner \, in the town hall and sat next to me. Mom? I croaked.  Yes Sweetie? She said in a sweet voice \, almost like honey.   Is this going to happen ever again \, this storm? I asked my voice still thick with dust. She did not answer and I knew that she knew this wouldn't be the the last time the black mountains of dust attacked the plain states.  "
6, "How the great Saltwater came to be     A long \, long time ago \, there were many gods. Two were Sarias the salt god \, and Walior the water god. They argued quite a bit and all of the other gods were sick of it. So was a newt named Yellow-Belly. I was the middle of the summer and one day when the gods were on a ship \, Yellow-Belly had also snuck aboard. Once again \, they were arguing and Yellow-Belly decided to put a stop to it once and for all.    Sarias how can you put up with that insolent Walior? You guys should have a battle and whoever loses will be dead and you won’t have to worry about arguing anymore.    Meanwhile up in the sky the other gods are trying to figure out a way to get the two gods to stop arguing but they didn’t want it to be in a violent way. They have no idea what the shrewd newt Yellow-Belly was up to.    Yellow-Belly gets Walior alone and now he want Walior to have a battle too. Walior why are you just sitting here you guys should have a battle to the death so that you won’t have to argue about who’s right anymore.    Well Yellow-Belly I don’t know what if I lose and get killed?    Walior are you really asking me that? Of course you won’t lose and get killed. I mean you are the better of the two. You are more handsome and way stronger. You have nothing to lose by having a battle because Sarias is sure to lose.    Of course you are right Yellow-Belly and that is a great idea.  Now Yellow-Belly has Walior eager to do battle with Sarias \, but what if Sarias doesn’t agree?    So Sarias have you made up your mind on whether you will have a battle with Walior?    No not really because I am worried that Walior might win.    Oh you mean that great buffoon. He couldn’t beat you if your eyes were shut and your hands tied up my lord. You have no need to worry about him because YOU are sure to be the winner. You are smaller sure but you have cunning and fearlessness on your side. I mean \, have you lost a battle yet? No \, because you are the best god ever.    I guess you are right and I will do as you suggest. But what about Walior?    Oh don’t worry about him my lord I have already taken care of him. He will die at your hand.    All right you gods are you ready for your battle? You know who will win and you don’t need to worry about it.    So Sarias \, you sure you want to do this? You know that I will win because I am much more handsome and I am way stronger.    Even so Walior I am more cunning and I haven’t lost to any beast yet.    There’s always a first time Sarias.    There was a great battle that lasted 8 days and 8 nights. Eventually Sarias emerged victorious. As he was standing over Walior and gloating: Ha ha I have killed you W…    As he said this Walior reached up and slashed him in the stomach. As Sarias fell from the pain \, his great-sword plunged into Walior’s heart. And so the great Sarias won the battle but he died in the end from his stomach wound because Walior had been very vicious and had cut a major artery. And so they both died because of a newt who was fed up with their antics. After they died \, they both had left behind great quantities of both salt and water. The other gods saw it and they had to figure out what to do with all of that salt and water.    They were smart and they did the smartest thing that they could think of. They mixed all of the salt with all the water \, and they made salt water. Then they picked a HUGE place to distribute all of it and there is now salt water because of that crazy newt \, Yellow-Belly.    But of course \, Yellow-Belly had to be punished. However \, the other gods were so happy because they didn’t have to deal with arguing between the deceased \, that they didn’t want to punish Yellow-Belly very much. They just sentenced him and all of his descendants to a life in pond water with NO talking.  "
7, "Dust Storm    My family thought our lives were absolutely perfect. My twelve year old mind thought so \, too \, until our Sunday paper arrived. I heard the clunk of the mail slot \, and sprinted to get the first peek of the paper. People on the first page were being interviewed by frantic news reporters \, wanting to know reasons for our year long hot weather. I thought they were crazy \, until they were right.    Days went by \, and the hot temperatures got worse. Hot baths were long gone \, replaced with iced cold water. We had all ate the cold foods we could eat \, no more ovens or fires \, if you were rich enough. Our family had a fire \, and a pan. We stopped doing that yesterday. I slipped out of my thoughts as my younger sister \, Leesh \, yelled out names. Mom! Dad! Mary! Come see this!    The yell was far distance \, followed by a scream so high pitch \, I sprinted outside \, into the woods to find Leesh. Mom and Dad followed \, pale with panic and worry. I smelled my own blood \, from all the thorns in our woods. I felt the trickling on my legs \, my bare legs \, and arms \, lucky my sundress hasn't yet ripped. Leesh! Leesh - where are you? I saw our fallen treehouse \, and something a little beyond the trees.     Mom \, Dad \, get Leesh down. I think I see something beyond the trees! They opened their mouths to say something \, but they were lost for words \, as I ran. Tree branches \, sticks \, thorn bushes \, and stumps were my obstacles. I noticed the animals all ran the opposite way \, with fear and shock in their faces and eyes. I got to the end \, staring in shock at the terrifying sight in front of me.    Over the hills \, rather than sun and clouds \, I saw it. A big \, pitch black cloud \, thousands and thousands of feet tall \, making any tree look like action figures. It moved with the wind blowing its way towards me. It came up the last hill \, the one I stood on. The dust cloud swallowed me \, and it whipped me in the face \, stinging me like needles piercing every inch of my helpless body. I still sprinted \, as fast as my legs could take me \, swallowing the dust in my mouth \, nose \, and burning eyes. I wheezed \, coughed \, and barely breathed. I felt myself suffocating \, remembering my name \, will myself I would make it. You can do this Mary \, you can get out of this. I opened my mouth to scream \, instead filling myself with gallons of dust in my throat and lungs. I realized I was finally back in the woods \, almost reaching my terrified family. I took huge rock \, and wrote with saliva and dust. My vision blurred and I tripped over tree branches \, rocks \, and anything in my way. I tumbled \, over my head \, crashing on the ground. I felt myself suffocate before my head hit the rock \, never seeing light or dust \, as my body shut down."
7, "The Boy    The young boy stood with the most menacing look he could muster spread across his face. He just stood there watching the endless columns stretch as far as the eye could see down the long \, dusty road. The soldiers would turn and look as they went by \,  and he made sure to look right back. He made sure to stare as far as he could into the dark pupils of their eyes \, as if it would raise the house that was now nothing more than a heap of ashes. Only a few charred remains of the walls were left.    As his eyes went from soldiers to remains he saw a small soft lump poking up from the ashes. He knew exactly what it was and he turned away. That teddy bear had been his favorite friend. Not a toy \, it was more than a toy to him. For a second he was back on a green lawn \, with the shutters of a house tapping softly on the window pane. And there was his bear. They waited for the next pirate ship to come around the bend in the road \, so they could board it and make the captain walk the plank. But then he heard a shout and knew he was back on the dusty road with no green lawn and no shutters tapping softly.    He leaped down from his perch on an old dresser \, one of the few things that hadn’t been pillaged or burned in the fire. He bent down \, putting both hands on his knees as his eyes searched the ground intently. He picked up the most deadly rock he could find and hopped back up on his perch to resume his watchful glare. No soldier escaped the watchful eyes as he probed them. The giant snake of blue tails was tapering off \, and the boy could now see the end of the tail. The boy once again hopped down from his perch. He could feel the sweat-covered rock in his palm. The last of the blue columns were passing.    The boy took a step forward and leaned back \, then whipped his body forward and released the rock at the same moment. The boy heard a thud as the rock came home and the rear most soldier clutched his side and looked back – but all he saw were those hateful eyes with tears rolling forth."
8, "Black and White Photo      I walked past the playground. The pigeons swarmed around the crumbs of food dropped by children \, and made a cloud filled with feathers \, dust \, and leaves. Admiring the day with every step \, I continued to walk through Central Park. I strode out of the park and onto the sidewalk. As I walked a few blocks \, I picked out the tourists from the crowds. Most of them were stopping by every table to buy either and I love NY shirt or a postcard.    Finally \, I saw the fountains and the big stone columns that protected the Metropolitan Museum. I ran up the endless steps \, dodging the people and cameras. I entered the cavernous halls \, donated my dollar \, and was directed through stairways \, exhibits \, and halls. After I walked through the Greek pottery section \, I entered the exhibit of Richard Avedon. It was my first time seeing his photographs \, and I was fascinated.    I saw portraits of Marian Anderson \, former presidents \, and Andy Warhol. The crowds moved slowly \, as if to try to suck up the emotions of the photographs for life. Several  people blocked doorways \, selfishly. With a little but meaningful push \, I moved on. Each room was watched by a security guard \, I thought of how lucky they were to be able to see these photos every day and have the time to think about each person being photographed. Most of the people were very important to society and history. Some photos were being blocked off \, from the amount of people crowding around them \, while other photos were lonely. I felt badly for those photos and made sure I stopped to look at them. Each photograph was in black and white but was able to capture the persons emotions and personality.     About three quarters of the way through the exhibit \, I came across a lonely photo. I immediately walked over to it \, and then when I was two feet away \, I realized that the man in the photo must have been upset and lost. The man’s face was round but hollow. His eyes were sunken in a he had dark bags surrounding them. He was beginning to go bald and his hair was warn and messy. He looked as if he hadn’t bothered to shave for a week and little black prickles were starting to grow in where his beard should be. He appeared crushed and broken. Small tears gathered at the bottom of each eye \, the type of tears that hadn’t fallen yet but made the world around you look blurry. His mind seemed chained to a memory that he couldn’t escape. I felt awful \, sorry \, and shocked.    Blinking my eyes \, I woke myself from my daze. I looked at the bottom left hand corner of the portrait. His name was Colonel Paul Tibbets. I had never heard his name before. Then I noticed the words under his name. He was titled as the pilot of the B-29 Enola Gay. He was titled as the man who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, "1945. As my lips repeated these words to myself \, I felt even more sorry and even more shocked. I sensed from the photograph that when he dropped the bomb \, he didn’t know what he was doing. The photo told me he regretted it \, and I sensed that he felt guilty and responsible for the 200,000 lives lost that day.    He was a man who made a huge impact on World War II. He is a man who models for us what war really is. He opened our eyes by dropping a monster who could not be tamed. Things like this happen during wars. People are killed. Not just the phony actors who spill their fake blood and fire their fake guns with fake smoke. Real people are killed. Nearly every person sees movies on wars. People are taught through commercialism that those movies are what was really is.    Before seeing this photograph \, I was like other people who thought war was a bunch of GI Joe’s \, dressed in camouflage \, being brave. But after seeing this photo \, I realized that war was just pain and misery. It made me wake up to the real world and learn that everyone is affected by war \, both those who are killed and injured and those who kill and injure them. Both sides of people are innocent. By looking into Colonel Paul Tibbets’ watered eyes \, I was awakened to what happened and what can happen in war. He helped define the word victim. In war \, those who are bombed \, hurt and killed are victims \, but those who are instructed to perform terrible acts in war are victims too. War affects everyone. Everyone is innocent. Everyone is a victim.    I wish that people could see this photograph before making opinions on war today. I wish that Colonel Paul Tibbets’ lonely picture was surrounded by crowds at the Met. I wish that he had the opportunity to teach more people from his huge mistake rather than us learning by another being made. "
8, "Daydreams of A Migrant Mother    The cool afternoon wind brushed against my face. I watched as the kids played with a rabbit they had found in the woods. All around me the sounds of the camp faded in my mind. The sounds of babies crying turned to a soft wail. The yelling of the kids turned to quiet murmmurs as I drifted into my mind.    For the past few weeks since we left Oklahoma \, I've been worried. It's been really rough living on the road without a proper home and I just really want the best for my family. The kids have been going to a public school just two miles from where we'd been camping. They've told me that the kids have given them ugly looks and said awful things about them calling them Okies or saying they were retarded. I couldn't stand any of my kids having to go through this misfortune. I focused my vision on my two kids Annie and Joey. They were laughing and shoving some grass in the rabbit's mouth. I didn't want them living like this but there was nothing I could do. I felt useless and weak.     The wind blew again and I went back to my daydreaming. My husband had been out for three days looking for any job available. We had planned to be at least in a home that put a roof over our heads but we accomplished nothing. Most of our close friends that had traveled with us already had a job and housing. The feeling bothered me. I looked around and saw some of the familes huddled under their tents. I don't want to be like this anymore I thought. But yet again there was nothing I could do. Sometimes I felt angry with myself. As if I wasn't trying my hardest \, but eventually it would just turn to sorrow.     My thoughts were disrupted by Annie and Joey running up to me smiling. I looked down on them and smiled \, wondering how lovely childhood must be with no worries.     Ma \, when are we going to eat \, I'm starving? asked Joey.    Even I didn't know the answer to that question \, we had completely run out of food. I pondered on how I would say this to them. I gave up and just said \, I don't know Joey.  "
8, "Deadly Ink  Queen Elizabeth I    One tiny black leg gracefully sweeps forward. Then five more identical legs immediately follow. The distance covered is just slightly over a mere quarter of an inch. Carried on its face is no discernible expression. The same face carried from the first introduction to oxygen. To freedom. To life. The little bug pauses shortly from its purposeful stride.    Yes indeed \, there is much happening outside in the country of England. The year is 1587, "and the month February. Everyone still wishes me to be married \, but I do not think it a wise idea. Should I hand my country over to someone else who will recklessly run England? No. I owe it to my subjects to keep them safe as long as possible \, and for as long as I am alive. I also at the moment need to keep my country safe from France and Spain who seem to be plotting against me \, planning to take over this country.    However \, my attention is focused on the bug. Such a frail \, helpless looking character.    The task at hand requires only a signature from me. My name \, written identically countless times before.  The consequence of signing this paper are far bigger than any paper put forth in my past existence \, unfortunately. This time my signature means the death of a fellow human being. My cousin \, Mary \, the Scottish queen.    The bug continues its deliberate march forward \, this time coming closer to the figure standing across from me \, the woman reading the paper. It seems to glance upward at my huge figure looming over it. Threatening \, but at the moment sitting still.    There is no question about what I must do. Mary has been kept in many different prisons here after being accused of plotting her husband’s murder and after escaping prison in Scotland to come asking for my help. I had no choice but to keep her here. I have kept her here for over twenty years. I could not leave her helpless.    Now \, however \, Mary is guilty of high treason. She was found to be communicating with France and Spain. She has been devising plans with them to take over England. To let her live would be wrong. Nevertheless \, she is a relative of mine. In addition \, she is a queen. How can I put to death royalty? The hand belonging to none other than me has to sign the paper for her death. Is there a special term for me giving approval to Mary to be killed? Regret? Shame? Murder?    A hand seemingly unnoticed by the bug raises into the air.    My signature is the task at hand. My signature is Mary’s death. The tip of my quill pen finds its way to the paper. My heart beat finds its rate speeding up.     I look up just in time to see the hand of one of my guards falling \, slicing through the air. A foot away from the table. Half a foot. Two inches.    The little bug looks upward at the hand falling above its back. It panics. The frail legs start to move as fast \, and almost faster \, than the bug knew it could. Not fast enough.    A cold chill runs down my back \, causing my hand to shake at the impact of the other hand hitting the table. Of the other hand hitting the bug. I look down at my signature. Elizabeth. In the middle of the z \, there is a tiny fault where my hand slipped. The bump is hardly noticeable to those who would glance at my signature in the future. However \, engraved in my mind is my name holding the mistake in the z \, holding the bug’s death \, and holding Mary’s death.  "
10, "The Day The Tractor Came    I was four years old when our house was destroyed. I didn't understand why but I could remember when the big red tractor came belching its smoke \, gleaming in the hot midday sunshine \, and rolling over the landscape plowing long furrows in perfect unison. Years later they told me it was the bank - the monster that lived and breathed profits from the land. We lived on that land and worked it until it was exhausted. I was still in the womb when the drought came with its monstrous black clouds of dust that enveloped the landscape. Pa said that the storms caused the land to be barren of profit. When the profit ceased \, the bank found other means to satisfy its never-ending appetite for the financial food known to farmers as profit.    I'll never forget the day the bank took our house. Pa told me that the bank was cultivating the land because we could no longer sustain the profit ourselves. I did not know nor cared what it meant. I was just a kid playing Indians and Cowboys with my two brothers and sister the day the tractor came. The shiny monster had been plowing the land all day long when it finally got to our small cabin. My father put up a stand \, but to no avail. The tractor driver delivered his monotonous address to Pa about the bank's situation and needs. Legally it was fair \, but it did not seem fair. Finally \, Pa stepped away from the tractor squatted down and buried his head in his hands. Without hesitation \, the driver fired up the incredible machine and let its engines roar. Looking back \, the tractor driver seemed to have an ultimate connection with his machine because he was an obstinate man controlling an unstoppable force. Slowly \, the machine approached the house as if it were not even there. At immediate contact \, the walls and roof caved in as if it were a flimsy cardboard box against a freight train. The tractor then proceeded without a care in the world \, unaware and unconcerned of the devastation left in the dust \, as if there never was a house there.    Back then \, I was merely a child watching and wondering what his father would do next. Pa had always been a strong man \, a man that our family could depend on. However \, in five minutes \, the tractor was able to reduce Pa to nothing. Never before had I seen my father break down with hopelessness. Seeing him there without a plan made me feel as though we were alone in a desert with nowhere to turn. But the tractor \, the arrogant tractor \, took my small life and shattered it into million pieces \, and left it on the ground in front of me. What few memories I had in that house flashed before me as I watch them knocked to the ground. My home \, the house where I was born \, the house where I learned to walk \, and the house my father had built with his own craftsmanship was so quickly destroyed \, returning to the dust from which it came. But what do I care? I was merely a child in a large \, dusty \, lonely world."
9, "Walking the Dog      I slouch on the couch \, comfortable in my favorite clothes \, staring at the news anchor as he drones on about that disaster or this riot. A snow storm is supposed to be moving in tonight \, the weatherman preaches. My dog Chloe lays curled up beside my feet \, with her head propped on her leg. She’s our pure bred Brittney Spaniel recently adopted and already a special member of the family. As I push myself into the cushions \, my feet nudge her a bit too much for her own taste. She then starts the slow process of standing up. She squints her eyes while she stretches out her leg \, as if trying to grasp at some imaginary treasure on the floor. With hesitation she pushes herself up with her hind legs first. Walking out of the room as if she had completely forgotten me \, she goes to check on her food that is so predictably there. I am amazed at how such an animal can keep to her schedule better than I do mine.    I then hear the all too familiar directive from my mother in the adjacent room. I have come to expect it \, yet it still gets me agitated. I sink even deeper into the warm embrace of the couch \, as if hearing nothing. I always delay as much as possible the dreaded task before me. After her third command \, I wearily begin to pull myself away from the comfort that has enveloped me. Out the window the flakes form horizontal streaks as the wind blows furiously. As slowly as possible \, I stretch out my arms and legs \, not wanting to leave the peace of the room.    I trudge up the stairs to change into something appropriate for the task that lay before me. Now fully awake \, I bound down the stairs. Searching for me gloves and hat \, and finding none \, I unwillingly grab my father’s worn knit cap \, only to be stopped by my mother holding mine in her hand while she rolls her eyes. Reluctantly I pull the gloves over my hands \, and my hat over my head. I stomp towards the door as Chloe bounds after me. Pulling down the leash and snapping it to her collar \, I slowly open the door and step out into the dark cold.    Just then \, the hard driving flakes seem to slow down \, and light upon the dust covered world. I take a deep breath of the rich air \, revitalizing me. Leaping down the steps \, I begin the route that has become routine. With Chloe at the lead \, no force but her adventurous spirit pulls me along. Passing her \, she takes it as a sign to quicken her own pace. She soon starts into a gallop \, pulling me along once again. I then hit full stride \, keeping abreast of while running together as if that was all there was to do. We come around the next corner \, and see the house in plain view. That quickly? It seems like only a few moments have passed before we begin to slow down. We both reluctantly slacken our pace into a slow trot \, and then a flat out walk.    Panting \, exhausted \, we climb the stairs with no real drive. Opening the door I begin the arduous task of drying Chloe off. With an annoyed look on my face and an edge to my voice \, I call to my mother to bring a towel. Through the door one sails toward me. Holding her tightly by the collar \, I ruffle her with the towel until she is sufficiently dry. As soon as my grasp releases \, she runs towards the kitchen to see my mother. I pull my hat and gloves off \, and put them both in their proper place together. Removing the now wet boots \, I bound up the stairs and change into my old clothes. I am soon back on the couch \, with Chloe snuggled at my feet \, I watch someone new talk about that political fiasco or this outbreak of malaria. With a pleased smile on my face \, I push myself as far as possible into the cushions and change the channel.  "
12, "Better Than the Sunset.    Adam sat on the porch and watched the clear blue sky. Today was his sixth birthday and all he wanted was to watch the sunset. It was only noon and he had hours to go. Inside the house his mother was cooking and his father was out in the fields. He didn't mind being alone on his birthday. He liked the quiet.    He sensed it before he saw it. Something felt wrong. Everything was too quiet \, much the same as the minutes before a hurricane. Those moments were magical. The world seemed to stand still; the air charged with electricity.    Waiting to explode into chaos.    Today was no different. A cloud that had not been present only seconds before covered the sun. Adam looked up and squinted into the still bright sky. The cloud covering the sun was alone. It would not be a thunderstorm. Suddenly a huge shadow loomed before him. It sped forward from the tree line and deftly made its way towards him.    Time slowed down and he watched as animals exploded from their hiding places. The wide yard was chaos as a hundred tiny bodies ran for cover. His breath caught in his throat and while he was afraid he could not tear his eyes away. There was something beautiful about the way the cloud of black dust crept towards him \, swallowing everything in its path. To him it looked like a monster. Big and ugly and destructive and yet somehow extraordinary at the same time.     He vaguely registered that his name was being called \, but there was nothing urgent enough to tear him away from the havoc unfolding before his eyes. He ignored the voices and watched as his mother's flowerbed was swallowed in seconds. Next were the tractor and then the shed. His big blue eyes grew wide as the cloud of angry \, swirling black dust drew ever closer. His heart pounded now not from fear \, but from something else. Adrenaline sang through his veins. It was exhilarating to watch his own death approach. He had no intention of dying today \, but he couldn't bear to run inside and lose sight of this beautiful destruction.    The voices grew more and more frantic and the swirling mass of dust threatened closer and closer. And still Adam sat \, watching and waiting for what was to be swallowed next. The shadow of this beast loomed over the house and he craned his head back to watch the hurricane of dust descend upon him. If possible time slowed even more. The door behind him burst open \, the wood creaking and groaning in protest at the force shoved against it. The span of seconds in which his father ran towards him \, shouting his name \, stretched and seemed to become years. His footsteps pounded against the rotting planks of the porch \, the noise exploding in Adam's ears. He looked between his father and the black monster \, which had now reached the bottom step.     His father's strong arm reached towards him and closed around is body like a metal vice. His small bones jarred from the impact. He watched over his father's shoulder as the storm wailed closer.    I'll catch you \, it seemed to be mocking. As suddenly as time had slowed \, it began again. The dust exploded around them just as his father slammed the door \, shutting out the world. Black dust curled under the door and shifted forward in fury. His mother shoved a wet towel in the crack and pressed another to Adams face. Together \, the three of them huddled in the middle of the room \, gasping and hacking and choking for air. But Adam didn't mind. He had only one thought as the black dust wormed its way into his lungs and stole his breath.     That was better than the sunset."
11, "All The Roads to Kansas      I was six years old when my mother ran off with the pizza delivery boy. She sent a note in the mail to my grandmother that read \, Katie’s at home. Needs food and clothing. Jane. Gramma drove the one-thousand-seven-hundred-twenty miles from Kansas to pick me up \, pulling into the trailer lot in her blue \, wood-paneled station wagon \, slamming the car door behind her. I was sitting in a rusty hubcap on the from lawn \, my chin cupped in my palm and my heart thundering wildly when she said \, Well \, I’m here.    She wore a pink silk handkerchief around the beehive of her blue-tinted hair \, a paisley mu-mu and orange scuffs on her feet. Red \, plastic-rimmed glasses hung from the chain around her neck and a cigarette dangled from the corner of her pink-painted mouth. She was terrifying.    She was perfect.    She crossed the front lawn without saying a word \, opening the door to the trailer as she looked back \, once \, for me to comply. I followed her \, remaining stubbornly \, apprehensively \, at the front door. She bustled around the house \, bundling up all my clothes and typing them with a piece of twine she found heaped in the back of her Buick. Before she decided it was time to leave \, she trussed me up in my snow gear \, explaining tersely \, Its cold in Kansas this time of year.    I had been sifting inside the trailer \, alone \, for three days. Leaving for Kansas was the most spectacular adventure I could imagine \, so wondrous I could barely believe it was real. She hauled me into the Buick \, grunting at the dead weight of my tense body \, and we sat on the leather bench seat of her car as she let it idle in the lot. She was flicking cigarette ashes out the open window when I mustered up the nerve to pinch her \, just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming.    What--? she narrowed her gaze at me \, dragging on the cigarette so the tip gleamed in a bright orange O between her lips.    You’re real \, I whispered in wonder.    As much as you are \, she huffed \, tossing the cigarette from the car and cranking up the window. Just don’t make a habit of pinching people to test out that theory \, ‘kay \, Sugar? She rammed the car into reverse and sped away from the lot. The pieces of my childhood were fading as fast as the scenery \, and yet I was filled with a sense of bone-deep elation. For the first time in three days \, I smiled.    I saw Gramma cut a look at me out of  the corner of her eye \, and nod. She glanced back at the road when she pulled the slip of paper from her pocket \, and said \, It’s all you’ve got of your momma \, so I figured you’d want to keep it.    I was six \, and I couldn’t read the words my mother had hastily scrawled on a grocery receipt \, but I kept that piece of paper fisted in my hand all along the roads to Kansas. Gramma \, I whispered after a few hours \, barely awake and suddenly terrified \, are you ever gonna bring me home.    I could see her eyes in the passing lights of oncoming cars \, watching them fill up with giant \, watery tears \, saw them go soft and achy. Oh \, Katydid \, she murmured gently \, reaching out in the darkness to clutch the fist that held my mother’s letter. We’re getting there.  "
11, "Playing Me    In the real world \, I am insecure. I walk down the halls of my high school trying to project an image of confidence and self-respect. Despite my concentrated attempts \, I feel neither of these. Like everyone else \, I want to be liked \, admired \, and respected \, the kind of person that everyone thinks well of. This desire to be accepted taints my personality \, causing an aspect of me to emerge that is not anything close to the reality of my character. Sometimes I can talk to a person and laugh with that person for a long time \, but that person still has no idea of who I am. They haven’t even scratched the surface \, but it’s not their fault. I can’t expect anyone to become acquainted with me when insecurity urges me to put on the face that I know they want to see. In my life of lies \, I have one truth. It is something I can never lie about how much I love \, no matter whom I talk to. I can never ignore the fact that it and it alone pulls me out and makes me real. When I am on stage I may be playing a character that isn’t myself \, but I \, for once \, am living the truth.    My head is bent down \, concentrating on the slippery \, uncooperative strings of the hoop tied around my waist. I suck my stomach in \, trying to avoid the inevitable moment when the safety pin that holds the thin fabric together will pop open and stab my belly button. The hoop flares outward from my waist \, just brushing the ground at my feet. It is a pale gray \, with irregular white splotches scattered throughout. The tissue paper thin fabric holds its hoop shape with the aid of three wicker circles glued to the inside. My corset sucks my torso in and pushes it up in all the right places \, making me feel feminine in the old-fashioned way. My bare shoulders display a faint bathing suit line \, partially covered by the wavy tumble of pale hair across my face. My arms are bent at the elbow \, my hands a faint blur as I struggle with my hoop skirt. The outline of my body stands out clearly from the dark of the risers stacked behind me. A gaudy assortment of costume pieces are sprinkled across the top of the risers \, awaiting attention or use.  My beat-up sneakers are visible a few feet away \, unwelcome reminders of the tenth grader in jeans and a sweatshirt who had first reached for the hoop skirt and corset ten minutes ago. The rest of my  costume is draped carefully behind me \, almost slipping to a puddle of silk on the carpet. In a moment \, I will emerge from behind the curtain and \, arms in the air \, wiggle the cool \, smooth dress over my head \, completing the physical transformation to my character. But for the moment \, I am engaged in the difficult task of securing my hoop \, the most integral aspect of my costume.    I loved the costume more than anything. In my opinion \, it was the best thing to ever come out of the U-32 costume closet. I loved the feeling of the swishy layers of skirts swaying back and forth as I stalked across the auditorium \, and the smooth touch of the satiny cloth against my back and arms. I felt as though I had become the six-year old version of me \, playing dress-up in my best friend’s attic. I used to find the most glamorous \, beautiful outfits I could \, and then prance downstairs and find some adoring grown-up to show off for. My friends and I would have costume parades \, and if we were at my house \, I’d beg my mother to take pictures of us posing together. As a little six-year-old \, I would have killed for this costume \, and let’s just say that ten years later \, nothing had changed.    The hour before each show is filled with a high concentration of pre-show adrenaline \, the imminence of the performance causing a delicious tension that hangs in the air. The cast and the crew rush madly around \, trying to accomplish a thousand things that all seem to be \, at the last minute \, the deciding factor in the quality of the play. Costumes are pinned or sewed \, makeup is slathered on by the spongefull \, and props are set in their places or searched for. Everything combined created chaos \, but in the beautiful way you only appreciated after it’s over. As we all try to do warm-ups in our crazy and uncooperative costumes \, I stare around the auditorium \, visualizing the people that will soon fill it’s seats. My gaze flickers up to the stage \, the beautiful stage \, and I picture our story unfolding across it’s face. I smile as I bend first to the right and the then to the left \, wishing that the pure excitement and nervous anticipation I was experiencing could be bottled and saved for later enjoyment.    My performance energy carries me to my spot backstage where I attentively list to the audience commotion as I squeeze the clammy hands of my fellow cast members. Then the moment comes when the lights dim and the audience falls into a unanimous hush \, just in time for the best sound of all \, the opening of the curtain. The stage lights up and the reality of the audience world gives way to focus on the set and the actors that enter our new world of the play.    I stand perfectly still backstage \, my eyes tightly closed \, listening attentively for Tamsen’s line to bring me on. I am silently mouthing the words along with her \, but I jump a little when I hear it anyway. And now for something a tad delightful \, a bit decadent \, and a little devilish…the Duchess of Dressing Up! The Duchess of Dressing Up raises her chin \, ignoring the momentary was of butterflies and the goosebumps that cover her arms as she moves onto the stage. I eagerly soak up the bright lights and the knowledge that everyone is watching me. I revel in this awareness \, allowing the audience presence to enhance my acting. I shut of all access to my ***ness and become someone else. My alter ego. My other half. My stage self. Each moment I spend on stage pulls more out of my character \, forcing me to focus and perform as hard as I can. I am in heaven.    Being on stage infuses me with a special feeling that I have grown o love fiercely over the years. It lends me the confidence and the self-respect that I constantly seek whenever I’m offstage \, out of the light. I feel like a fish in water; I am in my element. If I am on stage \, I am happy \, whether I’m front and center or somewhere out in the distant downstage right. When I say a line \, people listen to me \, and I can do whatever I want because it’s not me. It’s someone else. With that feeling of becoming another person \, I can get away with anything. Only then am I truly confident.    As I stand behind the curtain \, my fingers fumbling with my skirt and my hair cascading over my face \, I am not on stage \, but I am still happy. I am myself \, caught in a moment of unawareness \, caught in a moment of pure existence and not of performance."

When it was stormy outside \, the Mother Cat stayed in and kept her babies warm and safe. She also took the smallest one outside on a sunny \, snowy day \, and the dog helped her take the other three kittens out \, too. She  is teaching the babies about snow. The kittens mother is a good mother because: she keeps the babies safe \, she teaches them many things \, she loves her babies \, she asks for help \, and much \, much more! If the Mother Cat wasn’t a good mother she wouldn’t do all that good stuff!"

2, "Dear Mr. Davis: You should serve chocolate milk because it has 0% fat just like 0% fat white milk. Another reason is some kids will only drink chocolate milk. Another reason is both kinds of milk have the same amount of protein (8 grams) and calcium. Protein gives you energy \, and calcium makes your bones stronger. Chocolate milk is still really healthy even though it has chocolate in it."
2, "Thomas Edison 	I think that Thomas Alva Edison is the most important person that we read about because he invented the electric light bulb. Back a long time ago \, we did not have the electric light bulb. We had candles. If we did not have the electric light bulb \, we would have more fires. It would be a lot darker than it is with the electric light bulb. How would kids do homework in the dark?  How would we get around at night? 	If Thomas Alva Edison never lived \, what do you think it would be like? With only candles for light \, how would it feel?  What would it be like without the electric light bulb? What would it be like without Thomas Alva Edison?"
3, "School Year Time      I do not think school should be year round. Do you think school should be year round?       Without summer vacation \, students would not be able to go on family vacations. If a student wanted to go to a sleep away camp \, they would not be able to do it. At camp you learn how to do things on your own. If school was year round \, older siblings would not have time to teach younger siblings how to swing or climb trees. Teachers would also not have time for vacation.  Even if you are not at school \, you can still learn things. Teachers can also learn things outside of school.  Kids need to get their energy out. They can get it out by doing big races. In summer it is very hot indoors and children would be thinking about outside \, and not school. Children usually like warm or hot weather.  I know that towards the end of the year \, I look forward to summer vacation and I think other children do too! If a student wants to learn more things in the summer \, they can take classes about that subject. I do not think school needs to be year round!   "
3, "The Best Pet 	Are you looking for a new pet? I'd recommend a cat. For one thing \, they aren’t that expensive. You could find one on your porch and adopt it. Cats usually bathe themselves. Cats will sleep with you and can help you calm down when you’re upset or mad. Cats also don’t need training and you can leave cats home for the day. Cats don't need much exercise. So if you are looking for a pet \, maybe you can find some cats \, and you might find yourself a great pet!"
3, "Chuck E. Cheese’s      Once a year \, my family goes to Chuck E. Cheese’s. It’s a popular place. Chuck E. Cheese’s is a nice place to go because of the tasty food and the awesome arcade.    Chuck E. Cheese’s food is excellent! Their pepperoni pizza is mouthwatering. The salads are great \, with diced tomatoes. The selection of veggies is endless and very good. The macaroni has a special ingredient in it. Well \, it seems to. The food is scrumptious at Chuck E. Cheese’s.     While you’re waiting for your food \, the arcade makes time fly. You have to buy coins \, and each arcade game is only 1 coin. And if you do well \, you get lots of tickets to buy fun stuff. So it’s not wasting your money \, parents! The motor games \, such as the snowmobile \, four-wheeler \, motorcycle \, car \, and many more \, are great. The arcade is great while waiting for your food.    Chuck E. Cheese’s is bad for you but is great. I wish I could go there every day! Oh well. It’s fun going to Chuck E. Cheese’s because of the extraordinary food and spectacular arcade. I can’t wait to win some more prizes next year at Chuck E. Cheese’s.    "
4, "Which is Better?      Many people have a dog for a pet. Some people have cats. Which is better? I say dog. Maybe you say cat. I just might be able to persuade you in the following.    Dogs are great companions for lonely people. They can go for a rousing walk in the park or take a good long nap. Playing games of catch or fetch every day makes good fun. Even a jog on the hottest day could be enjoyable \, too.     Dogs don’t just provide fun \, though. They can also provide protection. Dogs are very intelligent. They can be trained to find people or save them. Some don’t even need to be trained. For instance \, if someone is trying to break in \, your dog might bark and scare them off. Dogs are great for many different reasons.    Overall \, dogs are awesome pets to have. Have I convinced you \, though? If you are convinced \, then great! If you’re not convinced \, then that’s okay. It’s really up to you. So which one is it going to be?  "
4, "Wow! I Am Glad We Have Zoos!      There should be zoos because they save animals and help people learn a lot about animals. Did you know thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don’t receive in the wild. I am so glad that there are zoos to save animals. What would we do without them?    There should be zoos because zookeepers give so much care to the animals. There are no longer cages \, and the fences are hidden \, so the animals feel like they're in the wild. Zoos make sure to hide the animals’ food so they can learn to hunt. Sometimes there’s tinted glass so the animals can’t see all the chaos going on. I am so glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals. Thank goodness we have zoos!    Without zoos \, a lot of animals could have become extinct. Zoos are trying to solve the problem of extinction \, and they’re doing a great job! Animals such as red wolves were saved. Zoos take a male and a female so they can have babies. This makes more animals of its kind. When animals mate in zoos \, their babies won’t get diseases from the wild. Zoos are trying to stop extinction \, and they’re doing great.    When visiting a zoo \, you can learn so much. You are able to see animals from faraway places without paying for  a $200 plane ticket. Zoos are a great way to learn and have fun. Not only do the customers learn at zoos \, but the workers do \, too—about animal behavior and how to make animal habitats better. Thank goodness zoos are here so we can learn a lot about different animals.    Zoos benefit both people and animals. We could help by going to a zoo and paying a fee to get in. When we do that \, all the money goes to the zoo and animals. It is important that we have zoos to help kids learn while they are having fun and seeing the animals in person. With your help \, zoos can support a lot of animals. So \, with that said \, the next time you do not know what to do \, go to a zoo! "
5, "Dogs are Best    Cats and dogs can be very entertaining. But when it comes down to the best pet \, I would say the dog.  One reason why I think dogs are the best pets to have is because you can talk to them and they listen to you. You can tell them secrets and how you feel. Kind of like a personal journal \, except they actually hear what you’re saying.  Another reason why I think a dog is the best pet to have is because a dog can warn you of danger \, and sometimes that danger might be life threatening. So \, with a dog \, it’s like you have your own danger alarm.  Also another reason why I think dogs are the best pets to have is that they keep you company. They are perfect pets to have if you love company. And with dogs \, it’s almost like you are having your best friends over. And better yet \, if you own the dog \, and it’s a weekday \, it’s like your friends are spending the night on a school night.    Another reason why I think a dog is the best pet to have is because they need to get exercise. You will have to walk your dog every day. So \, even if you don’t like to walk \, your dog and you will be getting automatic exercise. This will make you and your dog healthier.    Cats and dogs are very unique in their own fascinating way. But if I had to choose between the both of them \, I would go for the dog. Even though dogs require lots of responsibility and need maintenance and training \, they are still worth the effort. Most importantly \, a dog is like a best friend.       "
5, "Global Warning      Deep in the arctic \, a mother polar is returning from a long \, hard day of hunting. Looking ahead she sees the ice floes she uses to get home are much farther apart. It will be a lot harder to make it home. She jumps in and swims for it \, but pretty soon becomes exhausted. Just when she can’t make it any further \, another ice floe appears. She barely made it.      Sadly \, not all polar bears are this lucky. The North Polar ice caps are melting rapidly \, causing all sorts of problems needing grave attention. The cause of this problem I can sum up in two words. Global warming. Global warming is caused by carbon dioxide and other air pollution that’s collecting and trapping the sun’s heat. Many of us never dream that little things like driving a car and turning on the lights could be part of the reason this planet is warming up. Scientists believe that U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century. To make matters worse \, global warming doesn’t only affect polar bears \, but people and places all over the world. It is crucial we take action against global warming and all the issues it has caused before it’s too late.    Global warming is a huge problem most people don’t seem to be aware of. And the environment is just one of the things changing around us. Things never heard of before are jeopardizing our planet. In 2002, "Colorado \, Arizona \, and Oregon suffered through one of the worst wildfire seasons ever. At the same time \, Montana and Texas endured droughts that were creating dust storms. And to add to all these rugged weather changes \, just the next year \, 2003, "extreme heat waves caused more than 20,000 deaths in Europe and more than 1,500 deaths in India. Talk about changing climate!    And I’m only getting started. Let’s go back to the polar bears. As I briefly mentioned before \, in the Arctic and Antarctic dramatic changes are happening. Even though the Arctic is a region meant to stay frozen 365 days a year \, the ice cap is melting rapidly. Unless we stop releasing greenhouse gases \, the polar ice cap will completely disappear each year during summertime. In the book An Inconvenient Truth \, it clearly states \, This is a dangerous situation for all of us \, because the Arctic ice cap plays a very crucial role in cooling the entire planet. We are in a very serious position. We must stop Global Warming!    As Al Gore once said \, Each one of us is a cause of global warming \, but each of us can become part of the solution…   It isn’t too late to stop global warming \, or at least slow it down a bit. And who better than us \, the cause of this awful problem \, to do just that?    Tell me \, how often do you use your car? Don’t get me wrong \, I don’t want you to stop using it completely \, but cars are the 2nd largest source of global warming. Cars burn off tons carbon dioxide. This creates a hole in the ozone layer. Very \, VERY strong sunlight shines through the hole \, which contributes to global warming.    One quick and easy way to save money and gas is to carpool with your friends and family. That way instead of the pollution from 2 cars \, it will be just one! Or even better \, buy a hybrid car! These energy efficient cars have gas electric engines and cut global warming pollution by one third or more—much better then Hummers and SUV’s. The popularity of these cars has generated a 20% increase in transportation-related carbon dioxide pollution.    It’s hard to believe that something as simple as the light bulb could play a major role in global warming. But there is a way to save energy for everything. Instead of picking an incandescent light bulb \, choose a compact fluoresant one instead. You’ll lower your energy bill AND keep nearly 700 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the air. How about that \, a way to save money \, and the environment! Another way to reduce carbon dioxide pollution is to take a chance and try a refrigerator with the Energy Star label. That indicates it uses at least 15 percent less energy than the federal requirement. Try to make everything you do one more step towards solving global warming. Every little thing counts.    If we want our children to grow up in a carefree \, healthy world \, we need to start working toward it now. We are not just hurting the earth \, but hurting ourselves and the way we live. Some of it we can’t help \, but most of it we can and should try to change. When so much has already been lost to us \, think how life might be in a few years. In the words of Al Gore—  It is our only home.  And we must take care of it.      "

11, "To whom it may concern:   A group of parents \, and some teachers \, have made a proposal to the school board. They would like the school to participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week.  A week without any electronics is what parents believe the school needs. Technology is a big contradiction. It is useful with all the tools it has \, yet it can be a distraction \, or addicting. Our school should participate in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week because of the following issues with technology.   Based on a representative survey of 2,500 Americans…those who used social media had more close confidants \, says Keith Hampton. Facebook \, Twitter \, and other social media allow people to connect with each other and have social interactions \, but through the web. The web \, or a phone \, that allows people to be more social is a major issue today. Kids \, especially high school students \, feel no need to talk to a friend in person. They can just text them. The problem with Facebook \, or texting \, is that people interact differently than they would in person. Cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues with the web today. People say things on the web that they wouldn’t say to the person’s face. Bullies feel safe when hidden behind a screen. Whether or not the survey of 2,500 people was accurate \, it still did not account for the differences in interactions for media and in person. Having no electronics for a week would allow students to see that difference.   Although technology allows students to do research \, that research isn’t helping students to do strategic and logical thinking. What really makes us intelligent isn’t our ability to find lots of information quickly. It’s our ability to think deeply about that information \,  says Nicholas Carr \, author of the book The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains. Brain scientists have researched and found out that deep thinking only happens with a calm mind.  The greater our concentration \, the richer our thoughts \, Nicholas Carr says. The internet is a useful search engine \, but does not allow students to go deeply into thought. Google allows people to find anything by the click of a button. This isn’t the way students should learn. Nicholas Carr says \, If you’re really interested in developing your mind \, you should turn off your computer and your cellphone – and start thinking. Really thinking.   Technology can be distracting \, but most of all it is addictive. Scientists say that using email \, texting \, or searching the web can change how someone thinks or behaves. The stimulation [of technology use] provokes excitement – a dopamine squirt – that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence \, people feel bored \, says Matt Richtel of the New York Times. Addiction to technology may not compare to the addiction of certain drugs \, but being a student who is addicted to something that creates different social interactions \, and doesn’t allow deep thought \, could be very bad. In 2008, "people consumed three times as much [technology] each day as they did in 1960, " Matt says.  This rate has already increased \, and a break from it wouldn’t be a bad thing. Researchers worry that constant digital stimulation like this creates attention problems for children with brains that are still developing \, who already struggle to set priorities and resist impulses \, Matt says. Students in high school \, or even in college \, have brains that are still developing. A week off from the technology would allow these students to develop skills \, with their growing brains \, that could be used instead of electronics.   Our school should start participating in the national Shut Down Your Screen Week. It would allow students to see the difference in social interactions of electronics and in person.   The week would allow students to go into deep thought and understand subjects and ideas that Google cannot. Lastly \, technology is addictive and a break is what students need to understand the consequences of it being addictive. By our school doing this national movement \, we could change the way school is taught to better help each and every student.  "
9, "To Teachers and Whom It May Concern:    A proposal has been brought to the school board concerning the possibility of participating in Shut Down Your Screen Week \, a movement in which students do not use any electronic media for a seven day duration. Technology and electronic media have been shown to have a variety of negative impacts on people \, especially youth. For this reason \, I believe that participating in Shut Down Your Screen Week would benefit our students in a variety of ways.  There are many negative impacts of electronic media upon our students \, but among the most severe is its effects on the brain. According to the article \, Attached to Technology and Paying a Price \, technology is rewiring our brains. Technology has been proven to have significant effects on the way brains take in and process information. That’s not surprising considering people use an average of 12 hours a day (one half of every day) of media each day. The brain behaves hyperactively while using electronic media \, as it is presented with a deluge of data. This hyperactivity transfers into one’s daily life \, causing troubles focusing \, forgetfulness \, and boredom. A break from social media and technology would help students become more focused and attentive \, giving their brains a break from technology.  Additionally \, students could better obtain information without technology or social media. High-result-yielding search engines are not the most productive way for students to take in information. When a brain is using a computer \, it is taking in a great amount of information quickly. According to the article \, Is Google Making Us Stupid? deep thinking happens only when our minds are calm and attentive. With an overload of information \, the brain is not at all calm and does not deeply interpret information.  Although search engines like Google may present much information \, with its use \, little information will be internalized \, and little knowledge will be gained. During a week without technology \, students could gain and truly internalize knowledge.  I do understand that there are many benefits of technology in education. I understand that technology can help students efficiently find information \, and technology has even shown signs of growing neural circuitry in brains \, according to Attached to Technology and Paying the Price. Additionally \, according to the article Is Google Making Us Stupid?’ the efficiency of search engines outweigh the distractions. Due to the positive aspects of technology and social media \, I would not suggest that the school remove technology or social media for good. I believe that \, since technology is so addictive \, it would be beneficial to students to experience a week without it. During this time \, students would be more focused \, attentive \, and better internalize information \, along with innumerable other benefits.   Thank you for your time \, and I hope that you will consider my proposal. "
6, "Tom Sawyer       Having complicated characters in a book makes the story more interesting \, as well as enjoyable to read. Tom Sawyer is one of those kinds of characters that is very complicated and sometimes hard to put into one group \, such as likable or dislikable.      The book Tom Sawyer \, by Mark Twain \, is about a boy \, age twelve \, named Tom who lives in a small town in Missouri. He lives with his Aunt \, Aunt Polly. The Mississippi River \, which runs very close to the town is often the center of the excitement. The story is about how Tom grows up in the small town \, and the adventures he and his friends have.      I think that even though Tom does do some very brave and admirable things \, the author \, Mark Twain \, wants us to think of Tom as a character to dislike. For example \, Tom often gets his friends into trouble. Also \, Tom does sometimes steal things. When it is little things he is stealing \, like a doughnut from Aunt Polly \, it seems okay. But when it is bigger things from somebody else \, it is a big deal because whatever he stole could be important to that person \, or it could be necessary for them to survive.      However \, Tom is not only dislikable. He has done some very good things and it is easy to see why many people would like him. For example \, even when Tom runs away to be a pirate \, he still feels that he should say his prayers \, even though nobody is there to tell him he has to. He can also be very kind to his friends \, and help them when they are stuck in difficult situations \, or when they are in trouble.      One example of Tom being kind to his friends is the time when his friend Becky is in big trouble. She accidentally ripped the school Master’s book \, that she was not even supposed to open. When the schoolmaster found out that someone had ripped the book \, he was furious. He began to ask the students one by one \, who had done it. When he came to Becky \, Tom knew she would not be able to keep the secret \, so he jumped up and yelled \, I done it! That is an example of a time when Tom did a very brave thing \, by taking the blame for Becky.      Another example of how Tom could be considered a likable character is when Tom ran off to be a pirate with his friends \, Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn. Even though they had run off so no one could tell them what to do \, they found themselves feeling bad about the things they had stolen. They also felt they should still say their prayers \, even though nobody was there to tell them to. That shows that even though he had run away to become a pirate \, he is still good.      A third example of how Tom could be considered as a good person is the time when he saved Becky in the cave. It really was his fault that they got lost in the first place \, because he lead them further and further in the cave. But in the end \, he saved her. He left her and let her sleep \, and he traveled around the cave and eventually he found an entrance out. He then went back into the cave to find her. Then he makes his way back with her \, and they both are able to escape the cave. It was brave of Tom to go back into the cave for Becky.      A last example of Tom acting as the kind of character you would admire is the time when Tom was going to leave a note for Aunt Polly saying that he was not dead \, and had only run away. But Tom did not end up leaving the note. However \, he did kiss Aunt Polly in her sleep \, before leaving. This shows that even though Tom ran away \, he still cares about Aunt Polly \, and that is good.  However \, although Tom does show some examples of being a likable character \, he shows even more examples of being dislikable. One example of this is when Tom and Huck witness Injun Joe murder Dr. Robinson. Huck and Tom swear not ever to tell anyone about the murder. Later \, Tom breaks the vow \, and confesses in front of everyone. But Huck never broke the vow \, and in some ways Tom betrayed him. Also \, if Tom and Huck had told earlier \, but this time agreed to both tell \, Muff Potter would not have been falsely accused of murder. If Muff Potter had been proven innocent by Tom and Huck \, he would not be in jail for nearly as long as he was \, if at all.       Another example of Tom as a dislikable character is the day he meets the new boy. Almost the minute Tom meets him \, they are in a fight. Tom ends up winning \, and he beats up the new boy badly. That was a pretty mean thing for Tom to do \, especially when it is the new kid.      Another time \, Tom steals a whole leg of a ham. He and his friends are playing a game \, and Tom takes a ham from a family. That much ham is a lot of meat \, and for many families back then \, that much meat could last the whole winter. It was a really terrible thing to do \, because whoever he stole the meat from \, might even need it to survive. Tom should never have stolen that meat. His friends too had taken things like fish or bacon from other families.       A third example of Tom doing something that the reader would think of as a dislikable thing about Tom \, is again \, the time when Tom \, Huck \, and Joe run away. Tom knows that Aunt Polly is worried sick \, and very sad. But Tom and his friends don’t even leave a note to their parents \, or anything to let them know that they are okay. That is a very cruel thing to do to them \, to keep them waiting \, thinking the boys are dead.       But the most dislikable thing about Tom is the way Tom takes advantage of his friends. One example of this is when Tom is given the job of whitewashing the fence. Tom tricks his friends into doing his chore. He makes the job seem important by telling his friends that they would not be able to do a good enough job at it. They beg him and they trade him all sorts of things to do his job \, and he knows he is being mean \, and tricking them. Then Aunt Polly gives him an apple for the good work \, that he didn’t even do \, but he steals a doughnut from her anyway. Later \, when Tom goes to Sunday school \, he gives his friends back the things they traded him to whitewash the fence \, in exchange for bible tickets. The Sunday School gives out a blue ticket for every two verses memorized. Ten blue tickets equaled one red ticket \, ten reds equals one yellow \, and for ten yellow tickets you got  a copy of the bible. Tom traded his whitewashing earnings for enough tickets for a bible. Then in front of the whole Sunday school Tom receives a bible. I think that is a truly nasty thing to do. He basically cheated to get the bible \, and he cheated his friends.      Overall \, Tom Sawyer is a complicated character that the author wants us to think of as a dislikable one. Although Tom does do things that are likable \, the dislikable ones outweigh it. A lot can be learned from Tom about people’s characteristics \, and about what they are really like.  "
